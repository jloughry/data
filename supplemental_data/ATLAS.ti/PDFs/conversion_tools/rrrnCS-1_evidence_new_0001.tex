File 20120529.1900: Notes for meeting with Dr Fl\'echais tomorrow:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CS-2: The $R'$ developer had no process or procedures (policies and procedures, P\&P) for
		preparing a Common Criteria evaluation package.  This developer is normally entirely P\&P
		driven, in accordance with ISO 9000 and SEI CMM Level 3--5 audits.  The CCTL also did not
		impose a process or procedure beyond the formul\ae\ in CCv2.3\footnote{CCv2.1?} and that it
		was hampered by the lack of a Protection Profile (PP).  The only guidance was the CEM and
		the EAL.
	\item CS-1: In contrast, the certification of $R''$ also lacked a clearly defined process and
		procedures, in this case it was because it had not been done before, but the certifier and
		developer were both aware of this fact and worked together to a greater extent to ensure
		the success of the inaugural certification effort under the new criteria.  In fact, it
		worked so well that we recommend future certifications use the same process and develop
		policies and procedures from the observed sequence of events.
