Weekly activity report no. 20120209.1329 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0227, fourth week HT

Continuing to code CS-1 evidence in ATLAS.ti.  The `merge codes' feature
is helpful for fixing mistakes I made early on; the list of profiles
is accumulating new roles and references to codes.  By this point, I
am starting to encounter more analytical memos in the text; I am coding
them to return to after I get to the end of the data.  No other progress
to report until I get through the PDFs.
