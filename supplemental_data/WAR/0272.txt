I am working on writing the interpretations in Chapter 6.  I know I am
behind on my commitments for finished written work and I am trying to
remedy that; I have been working on parts of different chapters out of
sequence but which are necessary to hang together.  Dr Martin emailed
me today to say that both internal and external examiners have been
confirmed, and he wants chapters from me to review.

I have been corresponding with Nicholas Padolak for a few days about
medium and high assurance systems outside the cross domain solution
area, and possible application of my research to their C&A, or more
specifically, to their system development before the CT&E phase of
C&A begins.  He thinks it might be fruitful to essentially complete
some certification and accreditation tasks much earlier in the design
pipeline than is currently done, based on my data showing when certain
information first becomes known and when that information presently gets
to the people who need it.  Evidence would be carried forward encoded in
software configuration items directly, where it could be automatically
verified during integration.  In that conversation I had an insight about
how to explain part of the accreditor model that is counter-intuitive in
a much better way, and wrote it up.  I will send three finished chapters
to Dr Fl√©chais and Dr Martin in the next few days; they have both asked
for chapters to review as soon as I can get them done.
