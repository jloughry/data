Weekly activity report no. 20130822.1932 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0307 week 8+10 TT

I am back to writing after having got distracted by library research away
from it for a time. Thanks to prodding from my supervisors, early this
week I went through Chapter 1 and most of Chapter 3 with a highlighter
and marked every place that needs to change as a result of (1) examiner
comments in the report, (2) marginal notes in the examiner copy, or (3)
revisions I already agreed to make after the viva. I am now revising and
will send updated PDF files to Dr Martin and Dr Fl√©chais as soon as they
are done. I intend to re-submit the thesis no later than the earliest
date permitted, the beginning of Michaelmas term. The mystery of the
missing results letter was cleared up this week when it showed up again
at the Exam Schools, returned for 'insufficient address information'. I
verified my postal address in the University's system, and it is correct;
it must have been a mistake by the US Post Office. I spoke with the Exam
Schools about it and I have a scanned copy of the entire letter.

Reading group looked at the poster paper by Jedrzejczyk, et al. on
accelerometer usability from MobileHCI '10. I had a follow-on discussion
with Andrew Paverd about it regarding privacy effects of other sensors
(electrochemical, radar, spectroscopic) projected to become common in
mobile devices in a few years, judging from component manufacturers'
catalogues.

Aside from thesis writing, which I am back to doing, I have one outside
deadline, about two weeks from now, to submit final copy to the IEEE
HST'13 conference (and to shorten it by a page). Not working on that
right now.
