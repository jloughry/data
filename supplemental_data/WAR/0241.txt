Weekly activity report no. 20120517.1745 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0241, week 4 TT

Almost finished with CS-1 files and ATLAS coding.  Out of 1617 files
examined, 36 percent so far are relevant to CS-1 or CS-2; 733 files
remain to be gone through.  New codes appearing to become important this
week include rumours and unsubstantiated beliefs about the methods of
operation of certifiers and accreditors that are endemic at the developer
and programme office level; visible evolution of my thesis question;
and blind alleys that proved out to be unproductive.  I found a mention
of a planning estimation technique from NASA for planetary rovers that I
believe could be useful for projecting accreditation completion dates.
Another person gave me a 2009 paper by Barnes from which I got useful
techniques for qualitative analysis and organizing the lit. survey.  I was
emailed by Lockheed intellectual property counsel this week regarding an
invention disclosure filed in 2003; I provided the requested information.
Status: very close to finishing CS-1 codes and into filtering of CS-2
evidence.  Estimated completion date of CS-1 data analysis remains the
fourth or fifth week of May.
