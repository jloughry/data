Weekly activity report no. 20081113.2234 (GMT) sequence no. 0058, week 5 MT

I submitted my transfer report to the department today.  The final content
length was 40 pages, which is just about exactly the right size, and this is 5th
week of my fourth term at Oxford, which is also exactly right according to the
graduate student handbook.  I attended Prof. Kwiatkowska's talk yesterday to
transferring DPhil students at which she explained the new rules.

Next steps: continue on plan as defined in the transfer report (next week:
reading on research techniques).
