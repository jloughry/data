I have a cold or something that comes with a fever; I have been working
in spite of it, but with no progress. If this were a shared office
I would stay home to keep it from spreading. I am still cutting out
extraneous verbiage from Chapter 5; I need to read the whole thing from
the beginning to ensure it holds together; I can do that when I'm sick. I
have been in contact with a different manager at Booz Allen regarding
another job (IC A&A, reducing cost & schedule, related to my research),
but have received no response on the last two I applied for.
