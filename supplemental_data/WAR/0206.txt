Weekly activity report no. 20110915.1716 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0206, week 8+12 TT

I met with Dr Ashbourn to go over results from the viva and to go over
plans for Michaelmas term.  I obtained a useful reference on qualitative
methods [UK Physical Sciences Centre, 2011] before I left.  This week I am
reading three dissertations for their methods of using grounded theory;
afterwards I will schedule a meeting with Dr Fl√©chais to discuss.
I would like to plan another trip to Oxford near the end of the year,
either December or January, to present results in progress.

The Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) released version 4.0 of
the UCDMO cross domain inventory this week.  I met with the developer of
R's systems engineering manager regarding the trade study of OS options
for version 6.0 of R'' and details of the Navy transition funding.
The programme manager and government programme office are looking only at
immediate cost and appear to be ignoring the risks inherent in support;
I will work the new information into my model.

Security reading group was postponed this week but I found an article
to suggest for an upcoming session [Alexander and Smith, 2011].

TO DO: finish the LaTeX template and abstract submission process for the
OXFORD-CS-2011 conference; reading on methodology; set up meetings with
both supervisors to plan deliverables for this term.
