Weekly activity report no. 20080207.1610 sequence no. 0019 week 4 HT

I have started to work on systematically collecting information for my
literature review.  Even before I have a thesis, this is something that needs to
be done, and can be started now.  To that end, I've been entering all of my
books and papers into \BibTeX\ so they will be there when I need them.

Interesting books and papers read this week: 'Merging Paradigms of Survivability
and Security: Stochastic Faults and Designed Faults' by McDermott et al.,
'Computer Science Education: Where are the Software Engineers of Tomorrow?' by
Dewar and Schonberg, _Managing Projects with GNU Make, 3d ed._ by Mecklenberg,
the _Z Reference Manual_ by Spivey; and a couple of recorded Google Tech Talks
about the Fortress language by Steele.

Addendum: getting to hear the lecture by Fred Brooks on Tuesday at the comlab
was wonderful.  The guy has been everywhere and done everything.  He knew
Seymour Cray, Gordon Bell, and Gene Amdahl personally, and said he could always
tell when he was working on one of 'their' computers.
