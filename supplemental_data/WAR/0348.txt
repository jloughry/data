Weekly activity report no. 20140605.2022 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0348, week 6 TT

I have been working methodically over the last remaining chapter; I
did not get to the end last weekend but have five more good pages done
since. The historical time line is much better organised now. I intend
to finish the chapter in the next five days before GSS reports are due.
