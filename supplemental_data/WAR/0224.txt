Weekly activity report no. 20120119.2038 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0224, first week HT

University card expiration caused all sorts of problems.  For a while I
had problems with email, remote access VPN, student registration, and
U.S. student loans.  Everything is back to normal now.  I am grateful
for the help of a number of people in the department, my college, and
OUCS this week.  Thank you for your patience.

GSS reports were posted, and I talked with Dr Ashbourn by telephone for
the annual graduate consultation that my college requires.  Dr Ashbourn
asked me to prepare a week-by-week schedule and to meet with Dr Fl√©chais.
Time consumed in backing up files the night before, moving books,
and security debriefings all day precluded sending out that schedule
yesterday, but it will go out Friday.  The consultation was worthwhile
and useful.

Separation from Lockheed is complete.  I had a disagreement with Security
on the way out the door over some FOUO-marked and export controlled
documents I wanted to take with me; it was resolved by leaving the
material on deposit with the registry with the understanding that I
may request access to the file for study.  These papers are important
historical documents and should be preserved.  I have backups of my
important data off-line, but some of those are in Microsoft .pst files
and I have to set up an environment tomorrow to be able to read them.
I am resuming work on coding immediately.

Patent application was filed with the government today.  I worked out
an arrangement with Lockheed's legal department and government security
to handle the problem of prepublication review now.
