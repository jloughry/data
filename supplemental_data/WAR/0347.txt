Weekly activity report no. 20140529.1939 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0347, week 5 TT

I have seven more good pages done. I am going to finish the chapter this
weekend while everyone is on travel and the house is quiet. Ten sub-themes
have been identified in four groups: formal/informal communication, effect
of PM changes, composition of knowledge, and process improvement. No
other angles can be found.
