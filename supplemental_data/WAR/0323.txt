Weekly activity report no. 20131212.2054 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0323, week 8+1 MT

I emailed Chapter 3 to my supervisors this week, the fourth of seven
chapters (out of order). Next to be sent is Chapter 5, which is really
the main part of the thesis that the examiners wanted to be improved. I
owe my supervisors an index of examiner comments and their relation to
changes I've made in the text, and I have a list of things not done yet
including the index and appendices.

Other activity: I still need to complete the forms for a new visa. Working
on Chapter 5 to send in a week.
