Weekly activity report no. 20131226.2051 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0325, week 8+3 MT

I am still working on chapter 5 and have not sent it out yet, but I made
progress on writing and also drawing some new figures this week. To
explain the network diagrams, especially the overview and the second
case study, I am writing a description of every edge in the graph, and
in certain important cases explaining why edges do not appear in the
graph and why it differs from corresponding graphs in the other case
studies. Christmas has been busy, but I have been working too. I plan
to email this chapter to my supervisors before New Years Day.

Other activity: student visa forms waiting until after I finish Chapter 5.
