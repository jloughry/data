I decided that a sub-optimal method was good enough for the selection
problem at this time and stopped trying to find a more efficient one;
I got back on the writing-up task last Sunday night with the goal of
having my thesis feature-complete by the end of this week.  As of tonight
I am still working on that.  I wrote some notes on the plan of attack for
the optimal solution to be worked on later including a lower bound on the
number of operations for (n,k) accreditors.  Briefly, the method generates
a directed graph containing all of the allowable transitions from the
null set for a given n, then searches it exhaustively for any solutions
satisfying the guarantee.  If any are found, they must be optimal.

Writing status: the theory is in two parts, certification and
accreditation, although there are 'interesting observations' about all
kinds of related things attached all over.  The certifier part is done.
I am working on the accreditor part now, which is more difficult.
I hope to have it feature-complete by Sunday, and then go to work
on polishing the writing.  Today I had to spend some time responding
to an inquiry about a possible job from someone I know at Lockheed,
not for a job at Lockheed but another agency.  I made a few updates
to my CV, wrote a letter describing my research, and sent it along.
I was warned it was likely I would not hear anything until January,
but I was requested to get it to them today.

I am aware of the calendar and deadlines approaching at the end of
December.  I want to give my supervisors clean chapters to review.  I will
have some chapters for Dr Martin and Dr Fl√©chais in a few more days.
