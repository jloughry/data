Weekly activity report no. 20130314.2120 (GMT-6) sequence no. 0284 week 8+1 HT

I submitted an abstract to IEEE HST'13 (Boston, 12--14 November 2013)
in the cyber security track.  My UK visa was approved and passport
returned with a new stamp.  This week I received a letter notifying me
that my thesis has been forwarded to the examiners.  A small item I wrote
about daylight saving time errors in radio controlled clocks appeared in
RISKS 27.19.  I am working on the new paper and associated figures, which
describe the accreditor model in a different way now as establishing the
visibility of threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations from each data
owner's perspective according to the associated accreditor's clearance
over the space of all possible multi-level configurations, after which
we find the smallest set of covert-channel--like information flows
necessary to reach a concord about residual risk without violating
the global security policy.  I made a new contact at Quest Software,
in Seattle, who wanted to talk to me about a possible application to the
problem of compliance monitoring.  I talked with Jun this week about some
smart grid, SCADA, and cloud security needs that I know of at Lockheed.
I have been making a list of specific topics I could teach in case that
question should arise.  I volunteered a paper on Common Criteria mutual
recognition problems for the next reading group.
