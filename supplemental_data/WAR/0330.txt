Weekly activity report no. 20140130.1851 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0330, week 2 HT

I made good progress on Chapter 5 with a new network diagram showing
associations amongst all participants from the point of view of the
developer only. After lots of moving boxes around I was able to partition
off three distinct groups that can be shown to have had zero effect on the
outcome. There are a couple of surprising new links that never appeared
before. This new diagram is colour-coded and uses a whole page to show
relations than are not able to be shown clearly in two dimensions. For
one of those, I have not figured out yet what it means; I have to go
back to my notes to double-check that this person was actually in the
chain of approvals between BETA 1 and BETA 2 because he seems to have
been working for two different organisations. Partitioning the ST&E
activity and Charleston IV&V away from the central problem helped.

Other activity: the proposal that my co-authors and I wrote made it after
all onto the agenda for the technical committee's (TC) meeting Monday
in California; I can dial-in to listen. I have to work on the taxes;
2013 return is due next week.
