Weekly activity report no. 20121227.1610 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0273 week -2 HT

I am working on chapters 3 to 5 and 7 currently.  What was observed in
CS-1 and CS-2 is not, as first believed, due to the cross domain system
developer being misdirected by a progressive mismatch at each stage
between the intent of certification and accreditation authorities as
expressed through standards documents, operationalised by a process,
and then scored against steps in a procedure.  The slowdown emerges
instead from cues derived from the programme office, of all places,
interpreted as technical direction by people at the engineering level in
the developer's organisation and resulting in activity that is underdamped
by the developer's managers who at the time had too many projects to
oversee and whose attention was monopolised by a combination of programme
office and site demands.  This is a new interpretation of some data that
previously were tried to attribute to programme office's responsibilities,
but did not really fit there; the current interpretation explains the
observations without need of a hidden level of developer engineering
policy, which was problematic to stipulate without any evidence of such in
the developer's policy, process, and procedures.  The certification side
of the argument is sorted; I am struggling to explain the accreditation
side of the argument with reference to observations in the PDF files
making up Appendix B and not just to the model, and to tie down loose
ends in the methodology chapter.  The risk market idea has been dropped
for lack of time.  I owe chapters to my supervisors to review in advance
of the beginning of January.
