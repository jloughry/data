Weekly activity report no. 20131107.2328 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0318, week 4 MT

I made good progress this week on writing, adhering to the discipline of
committing changes to GitHub every day. I improved the description of my
thesis and tied each point to a specific contribution and then that to
a specific page or section where the assertion is justified. I am still
keeping track in a time log of exactly how every hour of the day is used.

I want to suggest a long paper for the next Reading Group. `Decentralized
Anonymous Credentials' by Christina Garman, Matthew Green, and Ian Miers
(IACR eprint 622, October 15, 2013) proposes trusted-authority--less
anonymity or pseudonymity using a Bitcoin-like distributed ledger. I
think it might be as important as fully homomorphic encryption, but I
haven't finished understanding the authors' argument. The paper might
have to be split over a few weeks because of its size. I have been
concentrating on thesis work instead of reading the article.

I will be on travel next week 11--15th November in Boston presenting at
the IEEE HST'13 conference. I will be working all week and still intend
to have the thesis finished and submitted before end of term.
