Weekly activity report no. 20140612.1848 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0349, week 7 TT

I did not finish writing the chapter this week but four pages more
are done now. The chapter is almost the right length and I will finish
it *this*week*.

The FAA issued a 14 CFR Part 25 Rule this week citing 'Special Conditions'
to allow interconnection of at least two of three previously separated
networks in Boeing 737 airliners (it was not even a Notice of Proposed
Rule-making.) The three network domains (Aircraft Control domain,
Operator Information domain, and Passenger Entertainment domain)
have always run on separate busses, primarily for historical reasons
(having been certificated at different times) but with assurance level
separation benefits as well. Since the adoption of DO-178/C two years
ago, first computers and now networks are migrating to VM separation on
shared hardware. I wrote a public comment about the lack of detail in
the Rule that was published in the Federal Register. No notice has been
taken by the CDS community at all despite similarities to automobile
vulnerabilities found by Koscher, et al. in 2010. [I have no time to
pursue this topic---I have to finish my thesis--- but it is important.]

GSS report has been filed.
