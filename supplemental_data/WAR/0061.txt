Weekly activity report no. 20081204.2331 (GMT) sequence no. 0061, week 8 MT

I met with Dr Martin after journal reading group this week; I have mostly been
reading and starting work on a journal paper that I hope to submit early in the
new year.  My transfer viva is scheduled for 16th January at 2:00 p.m.  I
checked with the assessors and they agree it would be helpful if I were to
prepare a ten-minute talk for the beginning of the viva on what I've done so far
and where I want to go.

Tomorrow I will present the weekly Software Engineering seminar in the comlab.

Next planned activity is to continue experimenting with encoding DCID 6/3 and CC
formatted text in s-exprs and manipulating them in that form.
