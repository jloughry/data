Weekly activity report no. 20130103.1804 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0274 week -1 HT

I am working on thesis for submission next week.  The concepts needing
to be presented fall into six categories: background, methodology,
data, model, observation, and interpretation.  The literature survey is
background and future work is included in the interpretation section
and conclusion.  The present difficulty is with narrowing the focus
sufficiently to describe the useful and relevant aspects of the thesis
without unnecessary information.  For example, the fact that some
undesirable information flows are forced and desirable information flows
inhibited in circumstances matching the global security policy suggests a
specific recommendation to improve regulatory standards, and so should
be included.  The obvious generalisation to a method of predicting
the direction and magnitude of all induced information flows in every
configuration of collateral and SCI-like accreditor configurations has
not been worked out completely, and must be relegated to future work.
I am trying to write honestly without overly broad claims of effectiveness
or applicability; the accreditor model is limited by stated assumptions
that vary slightly from standard practice and the certifier model is
derived directly from observation and not from a theoretical model.
The original methodology provided a direction of thought but the thesis
discovered in that direction was less directly related to observation
than it grew out of speculation about causes and effects not in the data,
but abstracted from it.  Application of the thesis is thereby possible
to every certification and accreditation, not just ones like the the
examples in the case study.  I am rewriting and will send new chapters
to my supervisors tonight.
