Weekly activity report no. 20090507.2249 (GMT+1) sequence no. 0083, week 2 TT

I met with Dr Martin last Friday; we discussed the outline I'd started of the
introductory chapter of my dissertation (covering the history and
interrelationships amongst various IT security certification and accreditation
standards in the US and UK).  Dr Martin cautioned me of the risk of running over
date and suggested that I should concentrate on the Methodology chapter of my
thesis instead.  We agreed that I would checkpoint work on the introductory
chapter, get what thoughts are in my head down on paper, and then shelve it for
later.  I need to get the methodology chapter done.  Start with the Transfer
Report and the assessors' comments from my transfer viva.

Dr Martin said he would look up the email address for Dr Ian Levy's PA that I
can use to set up an appointment.  I have not had luck contacting him directly
through the email address that worked previously.

No meeting this week as Dr Martin is on travel in Geneva and Edinburgh during
the weeks of 4th and 11th May.  I will report progress by email and send him
something substantive to read (by email) before our next meeting.

Upcoming deadlines and events:

22-26 June: Requirements Engineering (REN) software engineering module

TO-DO:

1. Checkpoint the introductory chapter work.  That means flesh out the outline
and file it together with relevant papers (MacKenzie and Pottinger (1997) and
Pottinger (1994)) for later.
2. Reading:
  (a) Dybvig (1996) on Scheme language
  (b) Butterfield (2008) on the Oxford English Corpus
3. Decide on what individuals I need to interview in the UK before I leave for
the USA in July.
4. Start files on all of the individuals (40 or so total?)
5. Contact Dr Levy's PA to set up an appointment
6. Verify that I am enrolled in the REN module.
