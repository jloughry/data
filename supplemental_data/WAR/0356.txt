In support of my argument that there are two kinds of channels
carrying information in the CT&E activity, I have identified analogous
characteristics, or mechanisms, corresponding to Shannon's definition of
channel coding, noise, and bandwidth. The coding in implicit channels is
more efficient than in formal channels, and requires more effort on the
part of the recipient to decode. (When placed against the inefficient
but robust coding of formal channels, this justifies both the relative
fragility and the practical necessity for implicit channels, thereby
explaining their emergence in almost all cases.) There is essentially no
noise in implicit channels. Forerunner communication---by definition,
implicit---is the most valuable of information, but also by definition
it is illicit (out of compliance with process), and therefore must be
encoded for security (of the transmitter) as well as for the available
bandwidth. (Implicit channels are narrow). Status: working on Chapter 5,
with some going into the conclusions in Chapter 7.
