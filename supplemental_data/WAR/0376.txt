I am determined to finish and give my thesis to my supervisors before
Christmas so they will have adequate room (without cutting into holiday
time) to read it. I am doing nothing else besides this. I plan to wait
until after the first of the year to send Julie the required GSO.3 form.

Last week's discussion in Reading Group of an important historical
cryptography paper was worthwhile. Reading Group is taking a break this
week for Christmas.
