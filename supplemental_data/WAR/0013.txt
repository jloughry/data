Weekly activity report no. 20071220.1450 sequence no. 0013 week 11 MT

I am enjoying the quiet at St Cross this week and reading, in preparation for
tackling the assignments for SCS and SDE, due in early January.

Dr. Martin and I have tentatively scheduled an in-depth meeting on 4th January
2008 at 10:00 a.m. to talk about plans for next year.

Merry Christmas to everyone!
