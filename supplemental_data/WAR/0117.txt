Weekly activity report no. 20091231.2212 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0117, week -1 HT

It is New Year's eve.  Next week is noughth week of Hilary term.
According to the guidelines I should apply for Confirmation of Status
during Hilary term and must achieve it before end of Trinity term
(19th June).  At this point I am raising a precautionary trouble flag.
I am running short of time and I'm stuck in a local minimum.  Any help or
suggestions for getting un-stuck would be greatly appreciated, although
I realise it's my responsibility and my problem.

Status: I remain ill with the flu.  I have spent much time this week
organising files, notes and other material for the new year.  I also
watched a lot of recorded talks from conferences, making note of the
technique of particularly effective speakers.  (Zed Shaw is a real
character.)

I feel like I have been stopped and not making progress for weeks.  I have
got to get myself unstuck.

Immediate task: to finish 2 papers that remain unwritten.

Plan: I need to make a plan.
