Weekly activity report no. 20140828.1927 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0360, week 8+10 TT

I worked on cutting down a large number of irrelevant events of 2009--12
in the case study (including some repeats) that were in the evidence but
no longer contribute to the theory. It was not clear before now that those
few events, transcripts of conversations, and observations---some of which
seemed highly significant at the time and comprise reams of data---ended
up being misleading, redundant, or later overcome by events. I spent
most of my time removing paragraphs, not writing new ones, all week (and
also fixing a technical problem with my LaTeX setup). I need another
week to finish Chapter 5. Plan for finishing: I still need to wrap up
the section on implicit channels and stop changing it, then tie it into
the grounded theory, then re-read the chapter as a whole.
