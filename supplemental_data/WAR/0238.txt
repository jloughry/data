Weekly activity report no. 20120426.1912 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0238, first week TT

Data analysis of CS-1 and CS-2 event logs continues.  I received from
Robert Glass a paper reprint of Craddock's 1999 article, needed for
a citation tying CS-2 characteristics to similar events in the past.
Coding in ATLAS turned up a connection between Backhouse and Dillon
(1996) and Kletz's recommendations (1991, 1993, 1999b) that I had never
noticed before.  I am going back through emails and logs from 2004 looking
for all examples of a catalogue of behaviours that occurred during the
CS-2 validation phase of the failed evaluation.  Some hypotheses for
the reasons underlying the different evolution of the CS-1 certification
are coming up.  Busted ones are kept in chronological order in the notes
file and show the progression implicitly, but I want to document it in
the tool somehow.  Status: working on two data analyses, nothing else.
Estimated completion date of data analysis is fourth week of May.
