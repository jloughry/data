Weekly activity report no. 20130131.1425 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0278 week 3 HT

I submitted my thesis to the University and I have the receipt from
the Exam Schools.  The title is Security Test and Evaluation of Cross
Domain Systems.  GSO.3 and GSO.15 forms are being processed now by the
department of computer science and my college.  It will take some weeks
for the examiners to read it and schedule a viva defence; in the mean
time I am starting a job search immediately.  Thanks to everyone who
waited and helped.
