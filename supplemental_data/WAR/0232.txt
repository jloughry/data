In the process of explaining the reason for them, I set down a new
classification scheme for cross domain systems, a division not currently
in the literature. Dividing operations around three axes of functionality,
which I am presently unable to collapse to fewer, it helps structure
the description of why some cross domain systems are more difficult
to develop, test, and accredit than others.  With five weeks before
submission, I am writing material as fast as I can for the examiners to
read, justifying the amount of detail needed to cover the whole territory.
I have sketched some figures to be redrawn later.

Reading this week on the causes of human error, which leads to trouble
in the certification process, and related thereto, R.V. Jones on the
delegation of information gathering by decision makers to subordinates,
leading to a mismatch in the understanding of the project at the highest
levels, where the direction was being steered.  I have got to get this
part of the dissertation right, because I'm not doing this research
for myself; I am doing it for the cross domain system developers
and accreditors who are depending on me to solve this problem.
A half-solution will not be enough; they are depending on me and I
have to get this right.  It is a major source of delay in operational
accreditations that has got to be fixed before long.  Status: I still have
to review remaining UCDMO presentation slides for the mandate promoting
SCAP; I have fallen way behind on coding artefacts in ATLAS.ti because
of wanting to write down ideas, and I need to improve entire sections
from outline to prose.  Working on it.
