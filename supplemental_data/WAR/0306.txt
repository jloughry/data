I got the examiner's copy of my thesis back yesterday. Comparing the
handwritten notes in it (fifty-two, including one repeated word and an
error in an equation that was noted at the viva) with the final report,
I can focus on exactly the areas the examiners found problems with. I
have not yet finished going through all the handwritten notations in
the examiner copy. Still working on revisions.

Further developing the argument for the grounded theory in Chapter 5, the
government's penetration testers fit the criteria for an 'obscure-benefit
domain' but differ from that characterisation of experts in that
for them, original research into 0-day vulnerabilities is at least
as important as hiring and alumni effects in maintenance of a supply
of esoteric assets. Because pen testers pursue a vulnerability only to
the proof-of-concept stage, conversion of knowledge to capital assets is
minimised. Instead, and unlike the other examples in the literature, their
intake is primarily of original research, whether internally generated or
purchased from producers, with ideas (e.g., Lipton's defence) and hiring
and dismissal being correspondingly less important. Starbuck (1992) is
primarily concerned with KIFs losing information capital through mobile
experts leaving the firm, although he acknowledges the parallel effects of
esoteric information leakage through imitation by other firms (either as a
result of publicity or after conversion by the KIF of esoteric information
capital into physical capital by the creation of machines, processes,
or procedures), and through obsolescence of information. `KIFs learn by
hiring, training and dismissing personnel', he says (1992, p. 736).
