Weekly activity report no. 20130620.2031 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0298 week 8+1 TT

I sent a full paper to the IEEE HST'13 committee (Boston, November).
It is the second round of referee reviews for this conference.
Notification date is 17th July.  The content of the paper is mostly
methodology, so work done on it was dual-purpose; I accomplished some
necessary updates for Chapter 3 this week.  Now that that's in, I am
going back to work on explaining the grounded theory.  I want to have
it done by report no. 300.

I have a new lead on a potential job at Seagate; they are looking for
security design architects (Colorado); the preferred qualifications are
a close match.  A friend at Lockheed is forwarding my CV to them.
