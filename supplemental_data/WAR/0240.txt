Getting close to entering the last of the CS-1 data in ATLAS this week.
I am presently going through meeting minutes of certifier, IV&V, and CT&E
telecons in the R'' evidence.  Out of necessity I have begun using more
dedicated codes for meeting dates and for proper names to enable sorting
of expressed opinions, actions, and consequences.  Linking of dates to
codes in a calendar is helping to keep cause and effect straight.  I have
1532 files left to examine on CS-1; after filtering out duplicates,
28 percent of all files processed are relevant which is 16 percent
of the collection.  At about sixty percent of the way through the C&A
record currently, with unclassified administrative work out of the way
and classified findings beginning to appear in the sequence of events, I
expect the rate of arrival of relevant items to increase for another two
days, then stop.  Coding activity is proceeding, with spiralling being
done to split or expand previous codes every time an improved approach
appears.  Status: working on CS-1 and CS-2 data analyses full time.
Estimated completion date of data analysis remains the fourth or fifth
week of May.
