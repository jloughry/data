Weekly activity report no. 20090205.1930 (GMT) sequence no. 0070, week 3 HT

I met with Dr Martin on Wednesday after reading group.  I have been doing a lot
of reading but not much of anything that shows progress or results.  We looked
at my planning schedule for upcoming milestones; there are two: submission
deadline for the New Security Paradigms Workshop is 17th April, and I had
planned to work on a paper for the journal _Crosstalk_ early in the year.  I am
behind schedule on that.

I registered for the ISSEP examination in London on 25th April.  ISSEP is a
certification programme for U.S. government standards (hence, very relevant to
my research!).  Reviewing for the ISSEP exam should be directly useful in
writing chapter 2 of my thesis.

I intend to keep reading for the next couple of weeks, but also to start writing
outlines for the two papers mentioned above.
