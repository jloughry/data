Weekly activity report no. 20130426.1939 (BST) sequence no. 0290 week 1 TT

I arrived safely in Oxford; my viva will be at 2pm Monday in room 441.
I have prepared a short introductory talk.

Reading group this week discussed 'The Core of the Matter: Analyzing
Malicious Traffic in Cellular Carriers' by Lever, et al. (ISOC NDSS 2013).
I completed drawing new figures for the IEEE paper on the improved
accreditor model.  Before travel, I met with Dr Martin via Skype.
I am updating the term card on the OUSS web site.
