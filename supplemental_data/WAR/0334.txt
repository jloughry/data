Weekly activity report no. 20140227.2038 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0334, week 6 HT

This week I worked on Chapter 5 more and added a section to Chapter
4 anticipating the part in the following chapter where I assert that
the differences between the projects cannot be separated from the
fact that many of the same participants worked on both (cf. tenure of
engineers vs tenure of project managers). I put a few references back in
(specifically referring to organisational document retention policy and
how it can damage the informal communication channels that are the key
to efficiency in the tasks the organisation wants to accomplish but at
the same time causes other informal channels to come into existence as a
result of it) because the references are needed now. I put the missing
diagrams on hold while I do this. I still mean to finish Chapter 5 and
submit it before the middle of March.

I have another interview with Google coming up soon. I have a bad cold
this week.
