Weekly activity report no. 20140911.1943 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0362, week 8+12 TT

I had an interesting discussion with the manager of a pen test firm that
serves mainly commercial enterprises. This person corroborated previous
observations in the second case study about the behaviour of and controls
applying to government security testers, viz., their operating limits, a
range of goals across commercial vs government customers, and pen tester
skill level. It seems to be a universal. I added this report to the
evidence. Current activity: reading through and cutting out words that
contribute no meaning to the argument. Still trying to work while ill;
it has got worse and I have an appointment to see the doctor tomorrow.
