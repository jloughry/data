Weekly activity report no. 20140306.1902 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0335, week 7 HT

I will send Chapter 5 to my supervisors next week; currently I am writing
more about formal and informal communications in the second case study
and in earlier observations at the same facility. As soon as this chapter
is finished and some clean-up work in the following chapters is done I
plan to submit my thesis at the end of March. The remaining pieces are:

- This chapter.

- Update the interpretation in Chapter 6 (to a limited extent) to match
the paper I presented at IEEE HST'13 in November.

- Update conclusions in Chapter 7 to match Chapter 5.

- Assemble the Appendices B and D, which contain the raw data needed
for replication.

The GSS report for Hilary term is done. I have an interview on 31 March
with Google. Working to finish this chapter by the 15th.
