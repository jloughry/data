Weekly activity report no. 20090402.2201 (GMT+1) sequence no. 0078, week 8+3 HT

I am reviewing Systems Engineering books in preparation for the ISSEP
examination coming up in three weeks.  I heard a tip that Ross Anderson's book
on Security Engineering is a source of questions, so I'm planning to read that
from cover to cover next.  My student loan cheque finally came through, which
reduces the worry about finances a little.

I have a meeting with Dr Martin scheduled tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.

Upcoming deadlines and events:

6th--8th April: TRUST 2009 in Oxford, St Hugh's College
12th April: Easter Sunday
17th April: submission deadline for 2009 NSPW
25th April: ISSEP exam in London
26th April: Trinity term begins
28--30 April: Radiant Mercury User's Group (RMUG) meeting
30th April: Infosec show (all day) in London; I am helping out
