Weekly activity report no. 20130502.1658 (BST) sequence no. 0291 week 2 TT

Viva voce examination Monday took approximately 2.5 hours; the examiners
were Dr Sadie Creece, University of Oxford; and Dr Howard Chivers,
University of York.  Afterwards I met with my supervisors.  The examiners
asked for some changes, which is not unexpected; they gave me a deadline
to finish those changes and sufficient time to do the work.  I met with
Dr Fléchais for a couple of hours Wednesday and worked out plans for
the next 23 days.  I am flying back immediately on United 955 LHR to
SFO; United 112 SFO to DEN to work; to be back in Oxford 20th May for
collaborative model building with Dr Fléchais 20--24 May.

Reading group this week discussed the paper 'Smart Keys for Cyber-Cars:
Secure Smartphone-based NFC-enabled Car Immobilizer' by Busold, et
al. (CODASPY'13, San Antonio, Texas, 2013).  I cancelled reservations
at two job-search-related events at St Anne's College and in London
next week to work on my thesis instead.  I took Dalton's book out of
the St Cross College library for reference.  OUSS lecture last night
was by Professor Joe Sweeny, University of Huddersfield, on synthetic
chemistry for pharmaceutical development.
