Weekly activity report no. 20140814.1908 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0358, week 8+8 TT

Precisely defining the characteristics of formal and implicit channels,
so that examples of each can be justified to exist in the data. I
compared it to the preference for two-person conversations, for when
legal discovery is undesirable, in situations where some kinds of email
or putting anything in writing is discouraged (Zawinsky). The total
information exchanged through implicit channels (developer-to-developer,
developer-to-tester, tester-to-developer, certifier-to-developer;
and accreditor-to-accreditor, in the case of SCI-like ST&E) is much
more important to a successful outcome than formal channels (which are
necessary but not sufficient); I can show the lack of implicit channels
in R-prime, now, in contrast to the formal channels, which were nearly
perfect. The argument is really coming together.

I was contacted by a manager at Booz Allen about a job in Colorado
Springs they are trying to fill; they are looking for someone with close
to my experience and qualifications. I gave the manager a résumé and
described in outline my research results. They declined to name the
specific programme but wanted to know if I had ever worked on certain
USAF Space Command programmes (I have) and could support research on
emerging technologies, and be the primary author of reports.

Status: I need one more week on Chapter 5 and it will be ready.
