Weekly activity report no. 20130718.2055 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0302 week 8+5 TT

I read some advice at the library on organising an argument that
proposes a theory from data (Starbuck, 1981, '92; Daft, 1995; Schneider,
1995). Some of the advice was written from the perspective of top-tier
journal referees and editorial boards so I think it is applicable to
answering the examiners' comments on my thesis. I did not make very
much progress this week on writing, but this evening I started writing
in the methodology chapter again.

Reading group this week discussed Tuomas Aura's paper 'Why You Shouldn't
Study Security' (IEEE Security & Privacy 4(3), 2006). Notifications
for the IEEE HST'13 conference in November have been delayed but are
expected to go out next week. Two systems engineering managers from
Seagate and Raytheon emailed me yesterday regarding security design jobs
they are trying to fill. I sent them work samples from previous projects;
Raytheon was interested in my current research but Seagate wanted to
know about crypto design work.
