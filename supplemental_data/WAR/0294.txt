Working in Oxford on network relation diagrams in ATLAS.ti for R' and
R'' case studies with Dr Fléchais.  We found some interesting things,
in particular successfully finding a way around a stubborn problem that
was obscuring a complete understanding of communication patterns in
both case studies; it turns out that by separating org chart roles from
decisions, and unofficial communication pathways from reports, a few clear
differences between the successful and unsuccessful case studies become
apparent.  I am exploring that idea with the network relation tool and
trying to uncover more evidence grounded in the data.  Another meeting
is scheduled with Dr Fléchais in the morning.  Reading Group met this
week to discuss experimental research methodology in cyber security and
software engineering.  Dr Eric Werner spoke to the OUSS gathering last
night on 'Cancer Networks', a new mathematical model for tumour growth.
Monday evening, I attended Professor Lee Smolin's lecture on a new theory
of time.  Tomorrow evening I will be at the Cyber Security seminar at
the business school.  I have to leave early Saturday for travel back
to the US; there I can finish arranging these network diagrams to fit
clearly on pages and write them up.  I was notified yesterday that my
proposal for a paper for the IEEE HST'13 conference (Boston, November)
was accepted; full paper submissions are due 19th June.
