Weekly activity report no. 20090813.2119 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0097, week 8+8 TT

There was no regular meeting this week because I was on business travel and Dr
Martin was on holiday.  I spent Monday through Thursday in San Diego, California
where I attended briefings at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Centre.  That
took up almost all my time so I did not get much writing done.  I did however
meet with Lockheed managers in the morning and evenings and got their approval
for my proposed (extremely limited) work schedule for the next year.  They
understand my schedule and milestones related to research and promised to leave
me alone to work on research as long as I get this one other work project (which
I had already planned on) done.  So that is under control now.

I got some more advice from Olav Kjono---the manager I most need to keep happy
because he corresponds to my funding source---on time management.  He was
talking about the redaction project, of course, but the same tricks may be used
for both that and my research schedule for the next year.  Having milestones is
important; also one other thing, according to Olav: testable indicators of
progress that can be used to prune the decision tree in cases where you're not
sure which of several alternatives is correct.  You don't want to spend all your
time available pursuing the wrong alternative and have that turn out to be a
dead end.  He suggested ways to avoid that.

Tomorrow morning I have to drive to a secure facility where I can type up my
trip report from San Diego and file it; then I can get back to work on research.

I will schedule a weekly meeting with Dr Martin next week.

To-Do List (abbreviated):

1. First paper final draft and submit to security review;
2. Prototyping (test different ways of encoding)'
3. Methodology chapter.
