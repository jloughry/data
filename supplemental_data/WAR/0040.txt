Weekly activity report no. 20080710.2010 sequence no. 0040 week 8+4 TT

Discussed methodology and writing techniques at weekly meeting today; I will
have a first draft of the Transfer Report for our next regular meeting,
scheduled for the first week in August.

Other activities: working on a new Request for Proposal (RFP) response at work,
due in one week.  Once I have that done, I can get back to my thesis and
transfer report.

I am going to submit a presentation to the Comlab Student Conference; deadline
is mid-September.
