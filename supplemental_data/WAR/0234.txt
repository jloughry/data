Weekly activity report no. 20120329.1951 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0234, week 8+3 HT

I met with Dr Fléchais by Skype video early this morning to talk
about my specific plan for finishing in a few weeks.  It followed a
long email exchange in the past few days where I asked for advice from
my supervisors about how to proceed.  Dr Martin and Dr Fléchais both
responded quickly and helped.  In the meeting this morning, Dr Fléchais
asked questions about the HAZOP application idea that I spent time on
recently instead of the intended analysis activity using grounded theory.
I explained why I thought the HAZOP angle was useful, but also said I
thought I had insufficient time to develop it properly, and probably
should drop it.  Dr Fléchais and Dr Martin have been talking, and asked
to see my dissertation in its current form right now, without cleaning it
up first.  Having anticipated the request, I had it ready and emailed the
file to Dr Fléchais after the Skype call along with the meeting minutes.
Dr Fléchais asked for estimates to finish coding of the the CS-1 and CS-2
case studies; I estimated 2.5 weeks and 4 weeks respectively, although
I have higher confidence in the first estimate.  Status: back to coding
for the CS-1 (and CS-2) analysis in ATLAS.ti and writing my dissertation.
