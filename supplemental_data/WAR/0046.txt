Weekly activity report no. 20080821.2145 sequence no. 0046 week 8+10 TT

I have finished mapping out a schedule of every event that needs to happen in
the remainder of my research.  I was in the midst of writing my transfer report
when it became clear that one was needed.  With the schedule on the wall,
arranging tasks in the transfer report is easier.  I am writing the draft
methodology section now.

Other activity: the Air Force proposal I was working on that I mentioned before
was accepted, and a contract given.  In is interesting only in that I was the
sole author of the proposal.  Work on the contract does not start until 2009,
and I might not even be working on it.  But it was a very researchy proposal,
and the military bought it, which bodes well for my prospects as a researcher in
the future.

I will have a draft transfer report to Dr Martin as soon as possible.
