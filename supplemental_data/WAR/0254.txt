Weekly activity report no. 20120816.1851 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0254, week 8+9 TT

I finished writing the first chapter this week on schedule.  Dr Fléchais
looked over my outline from last week and suggested that I make the
literature review a chapter to itself; I have done that.  The revised
schedule includes one more chapter:

Milestone 1: Chapter 1 (Introduction) due 14th August [done]
Milestone 2: Chapter 2 (Literature Review) due 19th August.
Milestone 3: Chapter 3 (Methodology) due 23rd August.
Milestone 4: Chapter 4 (Case Study of a Successful DIACAP CT&E) due 27th August.
Milestone 5: Chapter 5 (An Unsuccessful Common Criteria Evaluation) due 31st August.
Milestone 6: Chapter 6 (Interpretation of Results) due 4th September.
Milestone 7: Chapter 7 (Summary and Conclusion) due 8th September
Milestone 8: edit, rewrite, review by supervisors: last three weeks of September.
Milestone 9: CESAR 2012 camera ready paper due 17th Sept.
Milestone 10: submit dissertation Monday, 1st October.

I slipped the schedule as little as possible to accommodate another
chapter.  The end date does not change; the time available for editing
and rewriting is shorter by only two days.  The outline is unchanged
except for Chapter 2 which is now the literature review.

I owe Dr Fléchais a diagram of the complete theory.  It is not done yet
because I wanted to stick to my schedule and finish the first milestone
on schedule.  I will have the theory diagram done and delivered soon.

RCS ate itself around midnight Sunday and started truncating files to 64
K bytes on check-in.  All I lost was the bibliography file (598 K bytes)
and I recovered it from a backup, but RCS could no longer be trusted,
and I lost a few hours moving all files over to a different version
control system.

Status: writing Chapter 2 and I will draw the requested diagram.
