Weekly activity report no. 20071122.2029 sequence no. 0009 week 7 MT

I am in SDE (Specification and Design) course all week long.  All Z all the
time.  Very intense.  The group project, which I was dreading (because I dislike
working in groups) actually turned out to be sort of fun.  I got to learn to use
a new tool called fuzz for writing Z specifications.  It uses LaTeX syntax,
which I enjoy.

No other activity this week because of SDE.  I had no meeting with Dr. Martin
this week for the same reason.

I am scheduled to introduce a paper at Security Reading Group next week.
