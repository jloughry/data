Weekly activity report no. 20140213.1911 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0332, week 4 HT

Too many names of people and organisations appear in the rough draft
of Chapter 5 or in figures and I decided I have to get them out of
there. I expanded the list of anonymisation code names in Appendix C
greatly this week and have been colour-coding nodes and re-anonymising
names and relationships in network diagrams that were generated by
Atlas.ti. I have to let the tool do it that way, then modify them; if
I removed all the personal names from the HU file in Atlas.ti, it would
lose information. This way is more tedious but it preserves the original
data untouched, maintaining traceability. It means there will now be two
appendices containing linked pairs of evidence, one anonymised and safe
to view, and the other containing the original data as gathered. That
should be enough to satisfy the examiners as to the reproducibility of
all results. I made better progress on my thesis for the past few days
after losing ground last week due to illness. As soon as possible I will
give this chapter to my supervisors to look at.
