Weekly activity report no. 20080607.1145 sequence no. 0036 week 7 TT

Supposed to be working on my transfer report, but not much progress because
other events prevented me working on it very much this week.  My employer needed
a white paper aimed at convincing the U.S. Air Force to fund a research project.
 I wrote up something technical and speculative, and unfortunately they liked it
and asked for a whole bunch more detail.  Also, some family members are in town
and wanted to see London, so I was there all day on Friday.

Back at work on the literature survey now.

Graduate supervision report has been submitted.

I was supposed to meet with Dr Martin early next week, but I don't have anything
to report.  Maybe better to put off meeting for another week.
