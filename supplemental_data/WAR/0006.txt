Weekly activity report no. 20071102.2005 sequence no. 0006 week 4 MT

Sorry this report is late; I simply forgot to write it yesterday.  I have put
reminders in the calendar to avoid that problem in the future.

I have successfully caught up with lectures and assignments in Functional
Programming (FP) and Computer-Aided Formal Verification (CAFV).  My current
priorities are, in order:

Priority 1: Review Z language syntax in preparation for the Software Engineering
department SDE short-cource, which starts Week 7.

Priority 2: Stay on top of FP and CAFV assignments, two of which will come due
in the next week or so.

Priority 3: Prepare, if necessary, for the SCS intensive short-course, which
starts Week 6.  Currently I expect that not much preparation will be needed, but
I need more information.

Things that I need: I need confirmation of a place in the Software Engineering
department SCS short-course, which starts Week 6.

Things that I have promised to other people: to choose a paper to present and
talk about at the Security reading group in a couple of weeks.

Highlights of the week: I started reading two new books, one on CAFV to help
interpret the foreign language in lectures, and the other on Z.  Had a bit more
sucess understanding the Haskell language this week than last.  I would still
rather be writing in SPARK than Haskell, though, at least so far.  I had several
interesting exchanges by email with Dr. Martin about copyright, plagiarism, and
research methods.  He pointed me to a troubling recent study of plagiarism among
grad students in _information_security_ of all fields.

Outside Work: deferred while I was concentrating on school this week.
