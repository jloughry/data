Weekly activity report no. 20080529.2336 sequence no. 0035 week 6 TT

Working on first draft of Transfer Report according to the agreed-upon outline.

I have been cited!  In Ross Anderson's new book on Security Engineering, on page
543.  I got a whole paragraph, and my name in the index (for work that I did a
few years ago at Seattle University).

I attended several outside lectures; always looking for useful techniques of
research, maths, or presentation.
