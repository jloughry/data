Weekly activity report no. 20120830.1834 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0256, week 8+11 TT

I am done with Chapter 2 but have not turned in yet.  I got stuck last
week trying to include everything I ever read in the literature review;
it caused me to delay starting on the methodology chapter.  I am now
about a chapter and a half behind schedule.  I am working on it and
trying to catch up.  I had some new insights on how best to describe the
methodology.  A lot of it involves deciding how much material to leave
out: reading I did that turned out not to be useful, things I tried that
did not work, dead-ends I went down before backtracking.  Chapter 3 is
expected to be done in two more days.  Chapters 4 and 5 should go more
quickly than previous chapters because of all the things I have had
to review and think about and decide how to say during the writing of
the literature survey and methodology chapters.  The complete theory
diagram that I owe to Dr Fl√©chais is not done yet.  I will get that
figure drawn as soon as possible but I am trying to keep to my schedule.
