Weekly activity report no. 20130207.1859 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0279 week 4 HT

I am working on two new papers, one related to my thesis and the other
not.  Deadlines for the conferences I am targeting with the first paper
are in May.  I am thinking about wider applications of the method and
starting to put together a presentation in anticipation of the viva,
probably in March.  I have two appointments next week with people to
talk about job leads.  Catching up on reading this week and doing taxes.
Reading group meets Tuesday.
