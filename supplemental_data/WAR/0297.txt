Weekly activity report no. 20130613.1656 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0297 week 8 TT

Working from notes of my last meeting with Dr Fl√©chais, I have been
pulling out coded activities that I can identify as decisions into a
new layer on the network relation diagrams. That necessitated reworking
the anonymisation code scheme and running the autocoder a bunch of times
over the data again. I am trying another separate layer for forerunner
communications and trailing communications to see if it makes it more
understandable or not. Some of the participants in my case studies are
in the middle of a wildfire that has destroyed 360 houses in Colorado
so far and I don't know if they are all right.

I requested a book chapter that I need to reference from interlibrary loan
and got another via Amazon e-book for an out-of-print text (criticisms of
Dalton's methodology and research ethics from later ethnomethodologists
outside of the Chicago school).  In describing my research methodology
I have to distinguish it from the currently perceived shortcomings
of Dalton's methodology; specifically, I used no covert approaches to
informants nor did I select participants on the basis of their likelihood
of not jeopardising the study (Bell, 2010:124--5). However I did exchange
problem-solving work for access, held to be a confounding practice by
some authorities (Dalton, 1964:74--5).

IEEE conference paper due in a week.  Reading Group next week.
