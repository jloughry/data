I sent a new PDF file of the entire thesis to my supervisors tonight that
is missing only part of Chapter 5, some required figures, and the revision
notes work (still to do). I have been under the weather with a cold or flu
since Christmas, but working regardless. Appendix B now contains only the
extra data, and there is no more need for an Appendix D. I have less than
two weeks to finish now; notification messages from IT Services say that my
University email account and other computer accounts are due to expire at
the end of January. I emailed my College's academic secretary to ask if my
Bodleian card (and computer accounts) could be renewed into Hilary term to
avoid disrupting the thesis submission and examiners' processes.
