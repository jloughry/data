Weekly activity report no. 20080501.2134 sequence no. 0031 week 2 TT

I have been tied up considerably with Lockheed work this week, but thinking
about the thesis problem in the background.  I will bring a draft to work over
at the next meeting (Wednesday).

Next meeting scheduled with Dr Martin will be after security reading group on
7th May 2008.
