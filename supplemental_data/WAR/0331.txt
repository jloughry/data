Weekly activity report no. 20140206.2109 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0331, week 3 HT

I did not make much progress this week. I participated in a conference
call Monday in which I presented our proposal to the technical committee
and answered questions over an interval lasting several hours. They
voted, and the proposal was approved to go to JTC1/WG2. It is alive,
but this is the last I should see of that proposal for a while.

Other activity: completing US federal taxes; my return must be completed
not later than the weekend to meet a financial aid deadline. Between
that and taking care of a family member several nights this week I have
effectively been out sick.
