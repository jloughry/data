Weekly activity report no. 20130110.1747 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0275 week 0 HT

I am adding more information to Chapters 3, 4, and 5 to better support
the theory I argue for in Chapter 6.  This is in agreement with my
supervisors, the department, and MPLS.  The additional work required
has the effect of moving my planned submission date out from this week
to 25th January, a delay of two weeks.  The thesis will be submitted via
the distance printing and binding service offered by Oxford Print Centre.
I have been reviewing the new chapters with my supervisors and will send
the next one tomorrow.  The slight delay before submitting will also
having the data appendix complete for the examiners instead of partial.
GSO.3 form has been processed.  Julie Sheppard asked me to send her an
updated GSO.15 form just for the records, which I did, but that won't
actually be used.  Everything is going very well and this thesis will
be submitted soon finished and in time.
