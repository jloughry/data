Weekly activity report no. 20120308.1918 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0231, eighth week HT

Looking at HAZAN now in addition to HAZOP as possibly extrapolable
methods to find and mitigate `hazards', in a loose sense of that word,
in the project management process of a cross domain system certification
activity.  I got the ICE book from interlibrary loan for its definitions
of commonplace guidewords; I have time to develop this idea only to
a bare minimum, but it fits in Chapter 7 and needs to be included.
I have also this week been going through a file of direct quotations from
books accumulated over several years, tagging which quotations to use in
the text.  In between times I have been watching old UCDMO presentations
from past conferences to try to find the source of the mandate in 2011
that I need to use to justify the use of SCAP for evidence generation
prior to Beta 2.  I am thinking now that it has FISMA applications beyond
ICD-503 which would anticipate the NISTification of A&A beyond defence
that is coming in USG regulation; patterns are becoming discernible.
Status: behind schedule but working on it.
