Weekly activity report no. 20140821.1858 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0359, week 8+9 TT

The idea of bounding the parameters of [formal] channels and the
identified implicit channels that were observed in the data was a
good one; it worked. Some other approaches did not: slow progress to
report this week. I have not finished the chapter yet but I am closer
to finishing it. Plan for finishing: wrap up the section on implicit
channels by Friday night, then Saturday and Sunday, tie it into the
grounded theory, then read over the whole chapter from the beginning to
check it holds.
