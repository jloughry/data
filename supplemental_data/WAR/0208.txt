Weekly activity report no. 20110929.1652 (GMT-5) sequence no. 0208, week -1 MT

I met with my funding sponsor at the Air Force Research Laboratory in
Rome, New York this morning.  We demonstrated the software and I presented
the last two and a half years of research results.  The sponsor called it
an especially well designed research effort and said that their Technical
Council are very happy with them for doing it and want them to do more
like it.  I fly back tomorrow; tonight I am transcribing notes from
the meeting.

With the end of the Air Force contract, I have to find new funding;
unfortunately, the government underfunded my department at Lockheed
over a million dollars this year and they are trying to shed people as
it is.  I was contacted by a specialised information security group in
the company called JAGUAR who might try to hire me.

Miscellaneous: I was contacted by the MPLS graduate division looking
for my confirmation of status paperwork; it is holding up registration.
I emailed Julie Sheppard who tracked it down and got it signed; the
paperwork will be to MPLS by the end of the week and they can release
the hold on my enrolment.

I reviewed some security engineering process information for the Centre
for Cyber Security Innovation this week.  No reading group this week,
but most of my time was taken up anyway preparing a presentation for
the funding sponsor, travel, reports, and meetings.
