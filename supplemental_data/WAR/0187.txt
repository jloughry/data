Weekly activity report no. 20110505.1442 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0187, week 1 TT

I received Dr Martin's GSS report for HT2011; no problems there, I am
doing what the report describes.

Continuing to write.  I gave the first part to someone else this week to
read and criticise the style.  I got it back well marked-up with useful
suggestions for improving the written work.  Still calibrating my writing
style to the necessary tone; towards that direction, I looked at recent
dissertations this week for clues.

I read an interesting article on phenomenological research sent me last
week by Dr Jirotka.  Tracked down some needed information on new ITAR
regulations expected to come into force soon.  No activity at the R''
developer's plant on 5.01 CT&E testing this week; they are waiting for
the report from NSA I173 and an opinion from I8.

On the advice of a friend in the chemistry department at the same stage in
her research, I am striving to write a complete rough version of the whole
dissertation, just to have something to re-work.  I am trying to complete
that instead of making continual changes to parts I have already written.
