Reading, working on figures for the IEEE accreditor model paper, and
job interviewing.  I applied to several new job postings at Boeing,
Booz Allen Hamilton, and Lockheed Martin, and got called back for phone
screens with Tresys and Booz Allen.  Tresys wants to do an interview
about 1st May in Baltimore, Maryland; they will pay travel expenses.
Reading group meets again 9th April when I am to introduce a paper on
the Common Criteria.  I am rehearsing a talk for my viva and doing some
strategic reading on interview tips.
