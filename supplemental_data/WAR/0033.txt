Weekly activity report no. 20080515.2200 sequence no. 0033 week 4 TT

I introduced the new paper on malicious hardware from LEET'08 at Reading Group,
which spurred discussion on attack, defence, practical aspects (including
cost-effectiveness), governments, military use, organised crime, chip design,
the difference between rumour and scientific evidence, and limits of theoretical
computer science.  It was a great discussion, but I think I talked too much.

Transfer of Status: I am mentally going over the Transfer of Status process and
beginning to write a Transfer Report and work up a coherent presentation of the
research plan.  The next concrete step is the formal outline.

Extracurricular activities: I got to hear a couple of lectures this week from
Professor Loane Skene on academic career development and research ethics.  In
addition, two great names in computer science, Guy L. Steele and Richard P.
Gabriel, both gave two lectures apiece at the comlab.  Their papers are classics
in the field, and it was fantastic to see them in person.  I skipped OUSS's tour
of the JET fusion reactor in Oxfordshire, which would have been cool, but there
was another lecture that was more important: Professor Martyn Thomas on `Why
Systems Fail' which is right in the middle of my thesis topic; I couldn't
possibly miss it.

Lockheed work: I was asked to provide estimates to write a couple of white
papers for an Air Force proposal.  The topic has some overlap with my thesis
problem, so the necessary background reading meshes pretty well.  I emailed a
couple of people at University College London and Royal Holloway, University of
London, asking for copies of their dissertations, and got it.
