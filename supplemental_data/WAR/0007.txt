Weekly activity report no. 20071108.2156 sequence no. 0007 week 5 MT

I am scheduled to attend the Safety Critical Systems course (Software
Engineering) next week as an observer.  The week after that is Specification and
Design (SDE) which is more of a worry, but I am reviewing Z syntax in
preparation for the course.  More worrisome is the prospect of missing a couple
of lectures in Computer-Aided Formal Verification (CAFV), which is difficult
enough to keep up with as it is.  Fortunately, because the professor is out of
town, there are no CAFV lectures next week, so it's only the week of SDE that I
need to watch out for.

Exam dates for Functional Programming and CAFV have been published; I have until
week 8 when the exams are handed out to be sure that I can meet those dates.

Priority no. 1 this week: reading Z books.

Outside work: switching to half-time status (official) with Lockheed Martin
Corp, due to increasing time demands at school.  Applying for student loans to
make up the difference in funding; this will not appreciably change my funding
resources; just moves things around a little.
