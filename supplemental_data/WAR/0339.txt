Weekly activity report no. 20140403.1909 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0339, week 8+3 HT

In the time line of Chapter 5, I traced backward to the earliest
indications when funding issues began affecting certification progress,
and how it was resolved each time by the programme office (no pattern is
apparent). The remaining time line is still excessively large but the
size is coming down: it is currently 33 pages (at the end of Beta I),
wrapping up CT&E. The ST&E phase, as discussed earlier, occurred out of
view and represents much less data. The first phase was more important;
as one of the participants put it in an interview: '[Beta I] always
finds something".

I had a phone interview this week with a Google software engineer
in Boulder, Colorado. The interviewer had looked at my GitHub, and
connected that I had written some article or other he'd read. He had
me talk through data structure and algorithm programming problems for
about an hour: interesting ones, inclining strongly towards scalability
and extreme scales, as expected. At the end I was invited to a more
detailed interview on-site in Boulder, probably to occur next week;
I will get a call from someone Monday to set it up.

Status: I need to cut the length down from 338 pages to 200 including
anonymisation code tables. I shortened Chapter 5 by 47 pages in two weeks.
