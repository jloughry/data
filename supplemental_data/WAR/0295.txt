Weekly activity report no. 20130530.1603 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0295 week 6 TT

I finished up a week of meetings in Oxford and flew back on the weekend.
The collaboration meetings there were successful, yielding a complete
top-level network diagram of the grounded theory.  I have been going
through my thesis marking paragraphs that will need to be revised.
I am working on making sub-networks for the starred nodes (planned
comms, informal comms, decision-making process, process improvement),
attaching all the new codes to old coded locations in the data, and
making 'is associated with' relations more specific wherever possible.
There is unofficial communication that occurs before and after official
communications.  Under unofficial communications, subgroups have been
identified within the developer according to who received information;
subgroups within the certifier according to roles.  I attended the
Sa√Ød business school seminar on Cyber Security last Friday.  Working on
methodology and theory chapters this week.  No GSS report due this term.
I have been in contact with Revolution Analytics in Seattle regarding
a possible job lead.
