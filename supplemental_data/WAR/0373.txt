Weekly activity report no. 20141127.1445 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0373, week 7 MT

I was able to work effectively on my thesis nearly all this week and made
significantly more progress on Chapter 5, primarily in tying events that
happened during the certification phase, quotations from participants,
and repeated occurrences to similar patterns found in the literature. The
grounded theory in my thesis connects to numerous other theories by
researchers who studied manufacturing plants, research scientists,
spacecraft engineers, safety critical systems, illicit projects,
government contracts, software project failures, specialised law firms,
and consultancies. All are needed to understand the behaviour of cross
domain software developers with respect to government security testers. I
was disrupted by writing reports, but will be back to writing the thesis
tomorrow morning. GSS report has been submitted.

There was no Reading Group last week; tomorrow, the group will meet to
discuss a paper from SPIE Electronic Imaging (2009) on digital image
sensor noise forensics by Goljan, et al., and Professor Fridrich at SUNY
Binghamton.
