Weekly activity report no. 20091119.2143 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0111, week 6 MT

I have been writing a report on the Alpha testing experience of Radiant
Mercury (RM) 5.0 that I observed at Lockheed's facility.  It has been
going slowly because of continually stopping to look for references
as to when particular policy documents were signed, the relationships
of which document authorises which, and finding out where particular
terminology came from.  I promised this report to Dr Martin three days
ago but I am still working on it.  Our regular weekly meeting is being
delayed whilst I finish the report.  There is a lot of material and
after further consideration I think it may go into my dissertation later,
so I am going through it carefully.

Lockheed have been pressuring me for more design input on the other
project that I work on for them.  I think I can balance their needs
with getting this report finished in the next 4 days.  I will contact
Dr Martin by Tuesday 24th to schedule our next meeting.

Graduate student term reports are due next week.

Tasks (most urgent listed first):

1. RM 5.0 Alpha Testing report [urgent; tomorrow if possible, otherwise
	22nd Nov];

2. Lockheed design review on Probabilistic Redaction [due 24th Nov];

3. Crosstalk article [target date 30th Nov, taking into account family
	responsibilities around Thanksgiving holiday in the US];

4. Methodology chapter [needs replanning; goal is to have this written
	and finalised before 31st Dec];

5. Commence interviews on first case study [target: January; after
	Christmas when people are available again];

6. Prototype tool software development [target: beginning February after
	interviewing people; immediate task: write requirements doc and system
	spec first].

Next meeting not scheduled yet.
