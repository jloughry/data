Weekly activity report no. 20141120.2001 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0372, week 6 MT

I did not finish writing yesterday because I was helping a family member. I
will finish the chapter this weekend so that I can say in the next GSS
report that it is out of the way. The GSS report is due next week. Reading
Group met last Friday to discuss 'Interoperable Remote Attestation for
VPN Environments' (INTRUST 2010: Bente, et al.). The system they described
feels like it was built by a sysadmin. There was not enough detail for a
meaningful security analysis, but the paper has merit for 'we did this and
it worked'. At the end of the group meeting we decided it would be valuable
to save these discussions, and I mentioned that I have extensive notes from
approximately 43 reading group meetings going back to when I arrived. I
agreed to give all those notes to the group, but not until later when I
have time.
