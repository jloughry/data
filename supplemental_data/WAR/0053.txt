Weekly activity report no. 20081010.0124 sequence no. 0053, nought week MT

Working on Transfer Report.  First draft is not done yet.  I have a meeting with
Dr Martin in the morning.  I have to give a talk at the DPhil student conference
in one week.  The talk is written, I just have to practice it, and make slides.

I have travel scheduled to the USA at the end of October to gather more research
material, talk to some people, and obtain more approvals.

Other activities: none.
