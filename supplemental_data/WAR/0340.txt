I sent Dr Fl√©chais a copy of Chapter 5 which is still very much
unfinished. Meanwhile I am continuing to work on the chapter, summarising
all of the events in the second half of the second case study for the
time line, shortening the time line more, and linking specific events
and quotations to the evidence for the grounded theory. The amount of
data is still too large to reproduce in full; I need to cut it down. I
want to finish and submit by the beginning of Trinity term.

I have on-site interviews at Google one week from today. I watched some
of their recorded interviews for practice.
