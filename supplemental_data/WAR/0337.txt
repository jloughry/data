Weekly activity report no. 20140320.1758 (GMT-6) sequence no. 0337, week 8+1 HT

I moved data and analysis out of the appendices back into Chapter 5;
the level of detail is pleasing, but the chapter is way too long (eighty
pages currently). I am condensing the evidence into a time line of events
in the CT&E and ST&E phases with discussion sections interspersed. Each
discussion section follows the main evidence and separates data from
interpretation. I did not get it done by the 15th of March but condensing
is going very rapidly now. Progress: Alpha test phase is done; Beta I is
currently up to the June 2010 decision at which regression testing was
accelerated to force completion of penetration testing in order to get
it to the Beta II site in July for completion in August; Beta II is yet
to do. I should have the entire condensation done in three or four more
days, then I will send a draft Chapter 5 (with all diagrams included)
to my supervisors.

Google tech interview in two weeks. I have not started studying for it yet.
