Weekly activity report no. 20080424.2222 sequence no. 0030 week 1 TT

I am actively working on my transfer report.  Dr Martin and I met on Tuesday
morning.  I showed an outline of the proposed transfer report, although missing
a concise statement of my thesis problem.  We discussed defining the thesis
problem, some details of reviewing the transfer report, and the committee.  I
promised to immediately work on a clear statement of the problem so that I can
get on with writing the transfer report.

Next meeting with Dr Martin will be next week.  I will have something to discuss
at that time.

Journal Club is not meeting next week or the week after due to people being out
of town.  I found a new paper on malicious hardware attacks and put it on the
schedule to introduce in Week 4.
