Weekly activity report no. 20090423.2151 (GMT+1) sequence no. 0081, nought week TT

I met with Dr Martin yesterday and we looked at my TODO list.  I have several
ideas for different papers that are all in the outline stage now, but I am not
making enough progress toward implementation of the central idea of my thesis.
Dr Martin suggested two things: firstly, that I ought to write papers that are
actually thesis chapters; and secondly, that to our next meeting I should bring
the Table of Contents of my dissertation, where we'll set a specific goal for
which chapter (i.e. paper) to work on first.  The next meeting is scheduled in
one week.

I also reported on extensive email correspondence with Mr Kleidermacher of Green
Hills Software, in which I secured assurance of research access and a long list
of people to contact regarding the successful Common Criteria security
evaluation of INTEGRITY.

The ISSEP examination is the day after tomorrow.
