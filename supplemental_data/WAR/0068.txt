Weekly activity report no. 20090122.2117 (GMT) sequence no. 0068, week 1 HT

Transfer viva was completely successful.  I received the assessors' report and
discussed their recommendations with Dr Martin yesterday; we agreed on a plan
for the rest of the year.  Highlights:

1. I concur with the assessors' recommendation that `the focus of the
presentation of the research needs to be turned around: it should be about the
development of a methodology, justified by a failure---rather than the analysis
of a failure, accompanied by a potential solution.'

2. We discussed several alternatives to solve the linked problems of
intellectual property and funding for validation of the proposed automated
method and tool.

3. We agreed that more than one validation would be a valuable addition to the plan.

I will plan on attending TRUST 2009 in April at St Hugh's college in Oxford.

We also discussed my idea for starting a respository of transfer reports in the
comlab, and whether it could be hosted in the Oxford Research Archive.  I will
investigate.
