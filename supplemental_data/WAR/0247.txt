Weekly activity report no. 20120628.1958 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0247, week 8+2 TT

This week I worked on coding more CS-2 and CS-1 data and trying out
network relations in the editor for an upcoming meeting with Dr Fl√©chais.
In testing the practicality of using screen sharing through Google+
hangout with a friend in Oxford, I found an interaction with ATLAS.ti
6.2.27; it causes controls on my tool bar to flicker rapidly, and the
recipient sees a black screen intermittently.  Tested on Firefox 13.0.1,
Chrome 19.0.1084.56 m and 20.0.1132.43, SeaMonkey 2.10.1, and Safari
5.1.7; it is independent of browser in any combination.  An effective
workaround is to share the desktop instead of the ATLAS.ti window.
A bug report has been filed with the ATLAS.ti vendor.

I have been thinking more about the compartmentalisation issue and how
it manifests pathologically in FISMA reporting.  'In theory, [FISMA]
is a road map for developing a strong cybersecurity program[me] at
each agency...in practice, agencies often focus on achieving compliance
rather than effectiveness' [Tuutti, 2012].  There was a very interesting
comment posted on Schneier's blog last week regarding the Common Criteria
certification of Boeing's SNS.  After announcing their intention two years
ago to certify the product at EAL7, the certification report actually
came out at a surprising EAL5+, and the author guesses that it was done
for export control reasons.  The security target and validation report
reveal that this 'EAL 5' is augmented with a long list of SARs---almost
all of which are EAL 7 requirements---and the evaluator was NIAP CCEVS,
but for unstated reasons they chose not to call it that.  The developer
certainly has the resources to carry it out, so either Boeing either
thought it not worthwhile pursue EAL 7 (likely) or deemed it actually
counter-productive, which makes sense if EAL 5 certificates are currently
being approved for export.  This shows again that CC evaluations are
being gamed, but in the opposite direction now.  I think it presages a
move to NIST SP 800-37.

The weather has been 40 degrees C and wildfires all over the state.
Next supervisor meeting is 11th July at 1400 BST.
