Weekly activity report no. 20131114.2024 (GMT-5) sequence no. 0319, week 5 MT

I attended the 13th IEEE International Conference on Technologies for
Homeland Security (HST'13) where I presented a paper on my research. There
were three papers from Oxford in the conference, all in the Cyber Security
track. Of 85 full papers submitted to the track, 25 were accepted (29
percent). Some especially good papers I saw included identity management
(Creese, et al.); detecting insider threats (Garfinkel, et al.);
multi-scale graph partitioning (Hui, et al.); BGP route hijacking (Gersch,
et al.); maximisation of entropy in address space layout randomisation
(Kanter and Taylor), power efficiency of data-leak hardware trojans in
AES crypto circuitry (Reece and Robinson); and automatically extracting
privacy policy from the text of legal statutes (Miao, et al.). It was
interesting to observe how several presenters mentioned health care as
a potential application area of their research. I got two good follow-up
questions after my talk, one from Emily Frye of MITRE about how the shift
from C&A to continuous assessment affects the communication channels
that control the pace of C&A testing, and the other from Dr Anne Connell
of Carnegie Mellon SEI, who wants to use my results in their web-based
tool for massively distributed risk assessment.

I talked to Dr Stephen Polit (BBN and Raytheon) about their new secure
router although he wouldn't talk to me, citing Export Control, after he
saw the 'U.K.' on my conference name tag. I got to see MIT whilst I was
here. I did not get as much writing done this week as I thought I would
(busy attending as many technical tracks as possible) but I did get some
done. Returning tomorrow morning.
