Weekly activity report no. 20080808.1915 sequence no. 0044 week 8+8 TT

Met with Dr Martin on Monday.  We talked about progress toward a first draft of
the transfer report.  I described the improvements I made to process and tools,
and promised to have first draft of the transfer report ready by 18th August, so
we can discuss it on or about the 21st.  Goal is to have transfer of status
completed by the first week of Michaelmas term.

Other activity: did some work out at RAF Croughton and RAF Fairford this week.

I saw _Hamlet_ performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon
last night (the reason why this report is delayed).  David Tennant and Patrick
Stewart are very good.  I am not claiming to have followed all the dialogue, but
this was absolutely the best performance I have ever seen and I understand parts
of the play that I never understood before.  The character Polonius was great too.

Back to work writing now.
