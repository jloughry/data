Back to work on Transfer Report after moving house is finally done.  I am
concentrating at the moment on Methodology section and Literature Review.

Also, I am organising my source material archive.

both available.  I will have a new outline then.

My new address is 36 Plantation Road, Oxford OX2 6JE.  Telephone number has not
changed: 01865 516121.
