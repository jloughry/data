Weekly activity report no. 20141002.1944 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0365, week -1 MT

I had an unproductive week in which I did not get a lot done on my thesis;
status unchanged from last report. (Explanation: lost time due to flooding
in the house after several days of heavy rain.) I am still working on
Chapter 5, although accomplished some FIXME changes in Chapters 6 and
7. Government job interview in the morning but I will be back to work
on my thesis afterwards.
