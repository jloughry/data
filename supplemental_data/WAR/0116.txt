Weekly activity report no. 20091224.2226 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0116, week 8+3 MT

It is Christmas Eve.  I have been learning this week about use cases,
more ANSI Scheme, and the changes introduced in R6RS.  I am sick with
some kind of flu that seems to be hitting its stride this evening.
Not concentrating very well.  I hope everyone is well and warm and that
you all have a good Christmas.
