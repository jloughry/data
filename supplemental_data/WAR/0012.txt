Weekly activity report no. 20071213.1335 sequence no. 0012 week 10 MT

I have been attending the Design for Security (DES) course all week.  It is an
interesting course, and I have picked up a few new techniques.  Note: I am not
planning to do the assignment for this course, however (I need to concentrate on
assignments already received for SCS and SDE).  This is in accordance with the
previously agreed plan.  Based on what I have learned in DES, I think I would
like to take PAS (People and Security) when it is offered next time (it sounds
interesting).

No regular meeting with Dr. Martin this Wednesday, due to being in class all week.

Upcoming Tasks: I need to schedule an in-depth meeting with Dr. Martin to go
over plans for next term, probably right around the first of the year.

Current Activity: I am working on assignments for the SCS and SDE courses, due
in a couple of weeks.
