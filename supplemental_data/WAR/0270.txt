This week I solved the last remaining technical problem of my thesis,
in the guise of the selection problem for subsets of accreditors in
non-collateral accreditations.  Briefly, the problem is to identify
subsets of n accreditors that together satisfy some condition (that is,
no undesirable information flows are forced and no desirable flows are
inhibited) without incurring the exponential runtime of the conventional
solution.  I already had an efficient sequence for monotonically
increasing sizes, but what I didn't have was an optimal one for the weaker
guarantee that all subsets of size k will be examined before any subsets
of size k+2 are considered; at least I did not have it for n>3.  Monday,
I found it.  I now think there is a general solution for all n>0 and I
can write it up.  It is an interesting mathematical result by itself.
It is not yet known whether the solution for n=4 is unique or whether
unique solutions exist for n>4.  The question, relating to the number
of accreditors, was raised in the discussion period at the conference
I was just at, but I didn't have a good answer at the time.  Now I have.

I put off meeting with my supervisors at the beginning of this week when
the solution was first discovered Monday night, as I wanted to get it
nailed down first.  I am still working on the other weak spot identified
by questioners at the conference, drawing figures, and writing as much
as I can.
