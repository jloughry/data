Weekly activity report no. 20120802.1420 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0252, week 8+7 TT

I am working on the final outline of the dissertation and considering
milestones to set and stick to.  I have two months left to finish
writing my dissertation.  Keeping in mind that I do have to submit a
revised article before 17th Sept, I put that aside to concentrate on the
main task.  My college also sent me a letter also reminding me of the
submission deadline.  I am trying to avoid all distractions and I think
it would be a good idea to set specific milestones and report them to
my supervisors more frequently than these reports.  Milestones will be
tied to specific portions of the fixed outline.  Outline will be sent
to my supervisors shortly.

Other activity: I set up a profile on Google Scholar and put my CV
in github.  I thought they should be accessible in case anyone looks
for them.
