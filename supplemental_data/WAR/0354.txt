Weekly activity report no. 20140717.2207 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0354, week 8+4 TT

I worked all week in the library at the University of Colorado in
Boulder. I am lagging behind my promised schedule but making progress on
the remaining parts of Chapter 5; in addition I have also been updating
the interpretation and conclusions in Chapters 6 and 7. No work has
been done on appendices yet, as that depends on exactly which data are
mentioned in Chapter 5.
