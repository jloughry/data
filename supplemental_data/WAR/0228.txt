Weekly activity report no. 20120216.1337 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0228, fifth week HT

I am 70% done with coding CS-1 evidence and the bulk of the analytical
memos.  There are more analytical memoranda and they are more complex than
estimated, so it is taking longer than expected.  I have a new analogy
for explaining high-to-low cross domain systems in the introduction
and methodology.  The list of profiles needed for decoding roles is is
only half complete; I need to finish filling in details there.  I will
report progress to Dr Fl√©chais as soon as I get through the remaining
PDFs in a few more days.
