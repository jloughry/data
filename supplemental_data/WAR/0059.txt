Weekly activity report no. 20081120.2028 (GMT) sequence no. 0059, week 6 MT

I spent this week reading and catching up.  Security reading group this week met
to hear a talk on timing attacks against web applications.  The speaker
demonstrated exfiltration of data from behind a fairly strict firewall by three
means: (1) observing the response time of repeated SQL injections; (2) tricking
the target server into asking for recursive DNS lookups of nonsense host names
that contained embedded hex strings; and (3) tunnelling SSH through
reasonable-looking HTTP packets.  Nothing new in other words but it was
interesting to see the attacks demonstrated live during the talk.  This was
state of the art technique in 2001, but even today I bet most of them would
still be effective.  No solutions were presented, other than (1) sanitise inputs
and don't trust user-controllable data (obvious); and (2) keep up with the
latest and employ your own clever attackers first.  It was a fairly
disheartening demonstration of how far we still have to go.  He went right past
a hardware token, e.g., SecurID, for example.  A good intrusion detection system
would have triggered on the high level of anomalous activity required by his
exfiltration channel.  Of course, that can be avoided if the attacker is patient.
