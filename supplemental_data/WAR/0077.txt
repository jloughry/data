Weekly activity report no. 20090326.2042 (GMT) sequence no. 0077, week 8+2 HT

I was on business travel for a few days in New York, where I presented a
research plan to the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory.  They are funding my
project for rapidly declassifying PDF documents.  It's not school-related
research, but it keeps me funded and it's good experience with juggling multiple
research projects.

I have a meeting with Dr Martin scheduled tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.

Upcoming deadlines and events:

6th--8th April: TRUST 2009 in Oxford, St Hugh's College
17th April: submission deadline for 2009 NSPW
25th April: ISSEP exam in London
26th April: Trinity term begins
30th April: Infosec show (all day) in London; I am helping out
