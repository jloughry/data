Weekly activity report no. 20120705.1547 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0248, week 8+3 TT

I am still sorting and rearranging pages of evidence by codes and
categories for my meeting with Dr Fléchais next week.  Still using the
hybrid paper and ATLAS.ti method; I need to get all these codes into
the tool as soon as possible.  I have not done anything yet with the
network relation editor as I had planned before but I should be able
to start doing that by Saturday.  Going over all of he evidence again
from the beginning has caused me to re-read old writing with a different
perspective.  When I need a break because the data stopped making sense
again, I have been reading P. Tyler's 1986 book on Admiral Rickover and
the 688 class sub.  The methodology and evidence used by the author to
research the book is described in the prologue and I have been carefully
observing how interpersonal and cross-departmental interactions are
described and how they are interpreted by the author.  No new ideas
are in my notebook to report this week, however.  I uploaded a couple
of book reviews written previously out of my laboratory notebook to
(ISC)^2 for CPE credit.

Meeting with Dr Fléchais booked for next Wednesday at 1400 Oxford time.
