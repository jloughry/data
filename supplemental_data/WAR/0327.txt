Weekly activity report no. 20140109.1942 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0327, week -1 HT

I sent revised chapters 1 through 4 and the first part of Chapter 5 to
my supervisors this week. I am still writing the rest of Chapter 5, but
made improvements to the introduction, thesis statement, and research
questions in Chapter 1; as well as adding references in Chapter 2 that
were necessitated by new material in Chapter 5. Chapters 6 and 7 require a
few changes related to new material in the current chapter but are mostly
done; the index is incomplete, but Appendices A and B are automatically
generated and Appendix C is done.

I had a version control system technical problem this week, since
resolved, and collaborated part time on a proposal to IBM San Jose that
is due in early February. I still plan to have all chapters finished
this month.
