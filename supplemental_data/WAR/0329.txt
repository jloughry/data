Weekly activity report no. 20140123.1708 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0329, week 1 HT

My CM server failed and silently corrupted files in my thesis and
laboratory notebook; I discovered the problem Saturday night. By midday
Sunday I had recovered all lost data but it took until midday Tuesday to
fully repair all repositories and restore from tape. I have instituted
new procedures and controls to ensure it will not occur again.

I sent a completed ISO JTC/1 WG 2 'Proposal Summary Form to Accompany
Submissions' to the committee chairman for the February TC meeting agenda.

I am not finished with Chapter 5 due to time consumed by data recovery. I
did make some progress this week on partitioning network diagram
regions into CT&E, ST&E, IV&V, developer-internal, and certification
authority-internal groups including pen testers, CAA, and evaluators.
