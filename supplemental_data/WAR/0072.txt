Weekly activity report no. 20090219.2233 (GMT) sequence no. 0072, week 5 HT

I met with Dr Martin yesterday; we talked about planning over the next few
weeks.  I am reading US government standards at present, including a new book
(by Susan Hansche) that is an overview of current standards.  I asked for some
advice about locating equivalent UK government documents and Dr Martin pointed
me in the right direction there.  I am going to draw a taxonomy of standards
showing how they are interrelated.  Currently I am doing a lot of background
reading but not progressing toward the goal of a new working tool.  Drawing the
taxonomy ought to provide a direction out of the fog.

I received my formal transfer of status paperwork from the department.  No
action required.

26th February: meeting with Dr Ashbourn at St Cross College
5th March: 1500 Cakes Talk by Shamal
