Weekly activity report no. 20090129.2205 (GMT) sequence no. 0069, week 2 HT

I am studying a book about US government certification and accreditation
standards this week.  After that is done I plan to get back to working on
prototype software.

Upcoming presentations and calls-for-papers: (1) I agreed to give a talk at
Lockheed Martin (via teleconference) about my research in March; (2) the
submission deadline for NSPW 2009 is coming up in April; and Shamal is trying to
get me to enter a paper in a PhD student requirements conference in March.

Interesting outside lectures this week: Dr Scott Parazynski (space shuttle
astronaut who flew five missions to Mir and the international space station)
spoke at St Cross College about his experiences in spaceflight; Dr Clive King of
Sun Microsystems, Inc. gave a talk at Keble last night that unexpectedly turned
into a master class on OS internals---very interesting!
