Weekly activity report no. 20130627.1958 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0299 week 8+2 TT

I was most of my week in the Norlin library at the University of Colorado
in Boulder, revising network diagrams, expanding the methodology and
conclusions discussion, and improving the index. (I was trying to track
down a library book that is supposed to be there.) I will send revised
chapters to my supervisors next week. I emailed Julie Sheppard regarding
the examiners' report, which I have not received an official copy of yet
(not urgent). I do have a copy of the examiners' comments and suggestions
but not the approvals from head of department and MPLS division nor the
required date for submission.
