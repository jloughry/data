Weekly activity report no. 20080704.2102 sequence no. 0039 week 8+3 TT

Back to work on thesis, catching up after moving house.  I met with Dr Martin to
discuss methodology and specific goals for scientific contributions yesterday.
We went over the new outline, and talked some more about what the topic entails.

I am going to submit a presentation to the Comlab Student Conference which takes
place in Michaelmas Term.  The deadline for abstracts is about six weeks from
now; it will be a good chance to tell lots of people about my research topic,
perhaps flush another expert or two out of the woodwork, and fine-tune the
presentation of the Motivation and Methodology sections of my Transfer Report.

Next meeting scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on Thursday, 10th July.
