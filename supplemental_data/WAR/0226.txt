Weekly activity report no. 20120202.1752 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0226, third week HT

I met with Dr Fléchais via Skype on Friday and Monday this week.  We did
a shared session, coding several pieces of my CS-1 evidence through screen
sharing.  Dr Fléchais gave me advice on how best to use the tool, what
features to ignore.  I tried different ways of loading the whole corpus
into ATLAS.ti; the software doesn't like it at all when Primary Documents
change---it can cause codes to become misplaced.  Loading everything as
a single file did not work either when I tried it because of too much
unrelated information.  Instead, I spent the last few days running sed
scripts over the corpus and generating many small PDF files.  The PDF
files will never change, making them suitable for coding and archiving.
Because the files are individually tagged, it makes sifting out the
chaff much easier.  Besides making them processable in ATLAS.ti, the
work generating them will pay off when I have to defend the analysis
in the viva.  I am now coding each item.  After a complete pass through
the CS-1 data, I will share a copy of the HU with Dr Fléchais.

Miscellaneous: I did not attend Reading Group this week but sent ahead
some notes on the WPS specification.  The UCDMO has a new Director,
and DoD 8570.01-M Change 3 was finally released.
