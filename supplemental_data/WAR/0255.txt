Weekly activity report no. 20120823.2313 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0255, week 8+10 TT

I am slightly behind schedule because I kept going back over earlier
chapters and improving parts of it every time I edited the file.
I identified the behaviour and stopped doing it.  I am satisfied with
Chapter 1 and can leave it alone now.  Chapter 2 is very long but almost
done; the first two-thirds of the chapter are polished and the last third
will be finished and delivered tomorrow.  Chapter 3 is expected to be
not so large and I will be back on schedule by the end of this weekend.
I sent the first chapter to Dr Fléchais; the literature review and
methodology chapters will follow shortly.  The complete theory diagram
I still owe to Dr Fléchais is not done, but the time I spent revising
Chapter 1 helped formulate what needs to be shown on the diagram.
I will get that figure drawn soon but I am trying to keep to schedule.
