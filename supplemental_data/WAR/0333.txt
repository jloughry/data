Weekly activity report no. 20140220.1439 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0333, week 5 HT

I updated or wrote new material this week in chapters 3, 5, 6,
and Appendix D to take care of issues in my revision notes. Further
improvements were made to relations in more of the network diagrams in
the first half of Ch5 and I found a better approach to the behaviour
observations I am trying to explain. By looking at specific contrasts
between what failed in the 2006 security evaluation and what was was done
differently---I claim, as a result of them---in the 2010 certification
and accreditation, I think I got around that roadblock that has
had me stuck. I have not finished colour-coding network diagrams yet
because I had to spend time comparing and purchasing new family health
insurance to satisfy U.S. law; the existing plan was discontinued by
the underwriter due to changes elsewhere in the law and they have been
sending increasingly frantic letters and calling me on the phone about
it. I had a technical phone interview today with a software engineer from
Google; the interview went all right, and I am to have another technical
interview in a few weeks with an engineering team located in Boulder,
Colorado. I intend to be done with writing before then.
