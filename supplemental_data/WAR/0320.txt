Weekly activity report no. 20131121.1617 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0320, week 6 MT

I am ready to send chapters to my supervisors to begin reviewing. Dr
Martin emailed the other day to suggest a meeting; I asked for some time
on Skype to agree on a schedule. I can have the second chapter ready
tomorrow; after that I want to send another every three or four days.

Reading group next week will be going over Deena A's transfer report;
I have been reading it in preparation. Yesterday I spent hours updating
SSH keys in makefiles all over my GitHub repositories in response to a
security advisory about unauthorised login attempts coming from 40,000
IP addresses. GSS reports are due next week.
