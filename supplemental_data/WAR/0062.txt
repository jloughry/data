Weekly activity report no. 20081211.2020 (GMT) sequence no. 0062, week 8+1 MT

Back to reading this week.  Last week's software engineering Friday seminar went
reasonably well.  I have submitted the graduate student supervision term report.

Next planned activity is to continue experimenting with encoding DCID 6/3 and CC
formatted text in s-exprs and manipulating them in that form.
