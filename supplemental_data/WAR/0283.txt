Weekly activity report no. 20130307.2051 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0283 week 8 HT

The extended abstract is due to IEEE next week for my submission on
'a model of certifier and accreditor risk calculation for multilevel
systems'.  Tresys, Inc. (Baltimore, Maryland) asked for a summary of
my research.  Still no response from other companies.  I attended an
ISACA student group meeting at E&Y for a presentation on data analytics.
I received notification that my visa application is being processed
and expected to be completed mid-month.  I renewed my University card.
I have started collaborating with a researcher in the department of
social policy and intervention; they want to borrow some of my data and
have provided an informed consent agreement.

Reading group discussed 'A Decade of OS Access Control Extensibility' by
R.N.M. Watson [Comm. ACM 56(2), pp. 52--63, February 2013].  There was
some argument over whether loadable kernel modules in FreeBSD can be
trusted, because I claimed there is no reliable way in FreeBSD for
the module to be able to determine whether it was loaded directly
or interposed.  To defend against failures of the reference monitor,
I described a process used on a CMW operating system that continually
tested separation boundaries (process, file, message, label, and signal)
and communicated to a trusted process that had privilege to shut down
the system.  I noted some architectural features of the Burroughs large
system machines that are still ahead of their time.  Reading group is
looking for another paper for next week.
