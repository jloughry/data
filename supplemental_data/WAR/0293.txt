Weekly activity report no. 20130516.2023 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0293 week 4 TT

I am leaving Friday for collaborative work meetings with Dr Fl√©chais
beginning 1000 Monday.  I hope to be able to join the Reading Group next
Tuesday for the cyber security research methodology meeting, and I am also
planing to attend the cyber security research seminar Friday evening.
If all goes to plan, by the end of next week I should have the model
finished in ATLAS.ti and the only remaining work will be fairing it
into the original Chapter 5 and updating the methodology in Chapter 3
to correspond to the new work.  If any of the conclusions are altered
by the new model, Chapter 7 will have to be revised to match.

Tool report: ATLAS.ti version 6.2.28 began to slow down dramatically right
around the same time I finished coding.  Files are version controlled
in GitHub for backup and remote access.
