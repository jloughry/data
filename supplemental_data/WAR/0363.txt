Weekly activity report no. 20140918.1827 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0363, week -3 MT

I was effectively out sick all last week; I am still getting over it,
working at a reduced level. I am currently working to complete a full
draft of Chapter 5 to send to Dr Fl√©chais as soon as I can. There
is new pressure to finish imminently; I received a phone call from a
manager at Booz Allen Hamilton about a job in a nearby city, but only if
finished. I need to set a new deadline, fix milestones leading up to it,
and meet them. I have at most a week or two, but it is not certain.
