Weekly activity report no. 20080214.2227 sequence no. 0020 week 5 HT

Continuing to read, this week I have been looking at tips on conducting
research and planning a thesis proposal.  I am thinking of suggesting Richard
W. Hamming's essay "You and Your Research" for the Security Reading Group.  The
paper talks about choosing what problems to work on, and then asks, "Why aren't
you working on it?"  I am also continuing to BibTex all my old files.

At work, I've just been tasked with updating the design document that contains
the three-axis threat space model that I showed to Dr Martin last week.  I have
a chance to update it with new information.

There was an interesting colloquium at St Cross College with presentations on
particle physics and Transmission Electron Microscopy.  Gemma Tinti talked
about the MINOS experiment, which is getting data suggesting that the standard
model of physics is incomplete (meaning there is probably more left to
discover).  She showed how they shoot a neutrino beam right through the earth. 
When the curvature of the horizon gets in the way, so they just aim in a
straight line at a detector on the other side.  Rebecca Nicholls gave a talk on
TEM that showed pretty clear imaging of individual atoms in a quantum
computer.  Neat stuff.
