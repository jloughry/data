Weekly activity report no. 20090319.2108 (GMT) sequence no. 0076, week 8+1 HT

This week I completed the review of a conference paper submission (for RE 2009)
for Dr Jirotka and sent her my comments on the paper.  I have started working on
a new paper about Protection Profile approvals.  I met with Dr Martin today and
we discussed the outline of the new paper.  Lately I have found that meeting
every week is good; it keeps me on track.  We are going to continue meeting
every week.  Still trying to set up a meeting with Dr Ian Levy in the UK
government, but I have not heard back from him yet.

I will be out of the country tomorrow through Tuesday 24th March 2009 on a work
trip to New York.  I have to give a presentation to the sponsor (Air Force
Research Lab) of my new project.

I am still trying to stick to a regular schedule of research-related reading,
but events this week prevented it.

Upcoming deadlines and events:

23rd March: travel to New York for 4 days
6th--7th April: TRUST 2009 in Oxford, St Hugh's College
17th April: submission deadline for 2009 NSPW
25th April: ISSEP exam in London
26th April: Trinity term begins
30th April: Infosec show in London; I am helping out
