Weekly activity report no. 20080124.2202 sequence no. 0017 week 2 HT

I have been spending time reading, both on research-related topics and on
software engineering and about how-science-is-done in general.  Thinking about
the thesis proposal I need to write sometime later in the year.

Funding: all my student loans have been approved by the International Office,
eliminating any worries about funding for the next year.
