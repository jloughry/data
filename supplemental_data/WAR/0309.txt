Weekly activity report no. 20130905.1930 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0309 week 8+12 TT

I am trying to fit some of the improved results and discussion from
my thesis revisions (specifically, the theory for observed behaviours
in the second case study which ties to the accreditor model and the
certifier model previously presented) into the final paper for the IEEE
conference in Boston. The full paper for that conference is due next
week; I have to finish it and reduce the length by one page. I need to
prepare an oral presentation but that will be done after my thesis is
re-submitted. Travel reservations have been made for Boston the second
week of November. The official copy of my results letter arrived from
the Exam Schools; I called Ms Cahn to inform her it was delivered
finally. Reading Group did not meet this week. I emailed the St Cross
College academic administrator to request renewal of my university card
because US student loan repayment schedules are tied to the expiration
date on the card and I got a letter from the loan agency. Registration
for Michaelmas term is done. I am continuing to work on revisions to my
thesis and will send the first three revised chapters to my supervisors
in a few days. Michaelmas term begins in five weeks.
