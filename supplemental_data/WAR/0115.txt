Weekly activity report no. 20091217.1928 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0115, week 8+2 MT

I am working hard to get caught up on my thesis research.  I am re-reading
Dybvig's book on ANSI Scheme.  Going through notes from RM 5.0 Alpha
Testing and the final Alpha Testing report, which I managed to get
a copy of from someone in IV&V after the PMR last week.  I have been
asked to get up to speed quickly on use cases for a project at work.
I don't mind that because I can use the opportunity to start writing use
cases for the certification support tool I want to develop.  Shamal sent
me something to read; I will look at it in the morning.

I have noticed that it is getting easier to explain concisely to people
what it is that I am researching.  'Certification and accreditation
of existing systems where the certification process either is new
or has changed suddenly' is what I am focussing on.  I am starting
to think about the fundamental use cases implied by that description.
A lot of back-and-forth, but things are really starting to zero in now.
Good thing too, because I have about 170 working days left before it
is time to apply for Confirmation of Status.  That is a terrifyingly
short amount of time.  I have got to get the following 3 current tasks
completed and out of the way so that I can plan the next 6 months,
then meet with Dr Martin and go through the plan.

1. RM 5.0 Alpha Testing observation report.

2. Crosstalk journal paper, plus submit it to the editor before the end
	of the year.

3. Methodology chapter: planned to be complete before 31st December.

Government employees are all on holiday through the end of the year.
Lockheed is quiet also.  I am taking advantage of the lull to scramble
back onto research work.  Hopefully I will have a more complete progress
report next week.
