Weekly activity report no. 20121129.1512 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0269 week 8 MT

I returned from travel late on Sunday night.  From the conference
I brought back several more contacts that I made on the last day of
sessions and got feedback on my results.  I was asked for more details
on the software developer--certifier control channel and the expected
gradients in the 'SCI-like' accreditor model that explain the forcing of
some undesirable information flows and inhibition of other desirable ones.
I am writing a new section to explain those areas more clearly.  I got
an email from a person at Google who wants to collaborate on a project;
I replied that I have to submit my thesis first, but have arranged a
time to meet in January to talk with him about it.

Currently working on a more clear written explanation of the two weak
spots identified by questioners at the conference, drawing of figures, and
getting ready for the next meeting with my supervisors, which is not yet
scheduled.  I need to request a meeting, early in the week if possible.
