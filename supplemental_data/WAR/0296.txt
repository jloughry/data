Weekly activity report no. 20130606.1848 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0296 week 7 TT

Powell (1998) and Rao (2009), respectively, examine language used
to construct informal communication channels between dissimilar
groups forced by circumstances to collaborate across specialities and
distinct meta-levels of communication used within and between subgroups.
I referred to these this week, which point back to Whyte (1956) and Dalton
(1959 and 1964) as well as more recently to Rivera (2010), for standard
names to use for some types of informal communications seen in the data
and also to ensure I have spotted all of them.  (Formal communications
between developer and certifier are named according to CLINs.)  I have
still not finished making the second-level network relation diagrams
yet; I'll send the updated figures to Dr Fl√©chais soon, after I have
had time to work on them more Friday.  I received email from the HST'13
conference technical committee; they want final papers less than two
weeks from now but the information is identical, so I can work on both
at the same time.  Tresys called this week to see if I am done yet;
I asked for a couple of weeks and we arranged another call for Monday,
1st July.  Reading Group was postponed this week.  I have not received
the examiners' report from MPLS division yet...proceeding on their last
instructions to wrap up quickly but also to address every specific item
in the examiners' draft report.
