Weekly activity report no. 20110825.1623 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0203, week 8+9 TT

I put all the evidence I have together into a draft of Chapter 3 a few
days ahead of when it needs to be turned in (29th Aug).  Now I am trying
to smooth some of the rough edges.  Travel arrangements to Oxford have
been made; I will be there 6th to 9th September for confirmation of
status viva.  All of the necessary paperwork has been filed with the
government security office for international travel.  I am to Fedex the
written work ahead of time giving the assessors a week to look at it.

Miscellaneous: the funding sponsor wants a poster by 6th September of
the probabilistic redaction project; I owe the project manager a user
guide for the software before it goes into acceptance testing next week.
The legal department requested more details about a patent disclosure
I filed and how it differs from an Adobe technology introduced in 2005;
I have priority from 1999 but only if we write up a description of all
prior art.  The 2011 student conference web site and submission system
are now up and running; I am supposed to modify the LaTeX template and
write submission guidelines for the programme committee.  I also updated
the Oxford University Scientific Society web site for Michaelmas term.

Meeting with Dr Martin tomorrow.  There are 20 weeks to submission.
Upcoming travel: Oxford, 4th September; Rome, New York around 25th
September.
