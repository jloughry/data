I found a solution to the problem I had with the writing of Chapter 5. I
discussed the solution with my supervisors and I am implementing it now for
them to review. It will take only as long as changing all the verb tenses
in 36,000 words and getting the necessary network diagrams out of ATLAS.ti
and into the text as new figures. As soon as I have that done (tomorrow or
Sunday at the latest), and write a new chapter introduction, I shall send
my supervisors a new Chapter 5. After that, I need to do some clean-up in
Chapters 6 and 7 (the revision notes), and update the list of codes in the
appendices. I'll have it done before New Year's Day.
