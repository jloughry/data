Weekly activity report no. 20120412.1541 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0236, week -1 TT

Relating to the content of chapters five through seven described last
week, coding of items in the evidence is proceeding with reference
to identifying all occurrences of all crucial events, flows, or state
changes that must occur or run to completion if the certification testing
process is to succeed; at the same time I am flagging candidate certain
other events, that if not prevented or detected quickly after they begin,
doom the CT&E activity to becoming mired.  I hope to have a relatively
stable set of codes next week, after which it should stop changing.
I am using the same codes to point into a file of direct quotations and
citations collected all along.  My supervisors recommended this week to
file one more GSO.15 form, which I did, and to focus without distraction
on getting the data analysis done before allowing any more writing or
rescheduling; I am following their advice.  As soon as I have got the
analysis completed, I will agree upon a detailed plan with Dr Fl√©chais
and Dr Martin showing milestones they will hold me to.

I have started planning for when I need to go back to work in a few
more months.
