Weekly activity report no. 20120503.1941 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0239, week 2 TT

Intently concentrating on CS-1 data for the data analysis this week.
I have 2,438 more files to examine on CS-1, most of them not relevant
to the project; after throwing out duplicates, 4 percent are found to be
relevant, although I expect that rate to increase greatly as I get closer
to the present.  Coding of items in ATLAS is done during breaks from
looking at evidence files, or any time thoughts about events seen in the
evidence occur.  Robert L. Glass sent me another reprint, this one from
1993, and referred me to a parallel situation in chapter 2 of a recent
book.  I have thinking forward to the model building stage of the GTM.
That will not occur until after coding and network relations are done,
but I am thinking about it as I go along.  Must finish coding items first.
I am still listing behaviour patterns in the CS-1 event log that match
or are absent from the sequence of CS-2 events.  Status: working on two
data analyses and avoiding distractions as much as possible.  Estimated
completion date of data analysis is still the fourth week of May.
