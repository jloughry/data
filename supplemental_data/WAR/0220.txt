Weekly activity report no. 20111222.1701 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0220, week 8+3 MT

I met with Dr Martin by Skype to discuss the accelerated schedule.
Afterwards I sent a long letter to Dr Fl√©chais bringing him up to date
on recent changes and asking advice on how to get the work done in time.
I sent the new schedule to Dr Ashbourn at my college and received an
acknowledgement.  The revised schedule requires submission by 20th April;
that compresses the amount of time allocated to coding and analysis of
case studies, but I came up with a new way of tracking progress in coding.
The rate needs to be consistently above 50 items/day; it is well below
that presently because I am still working on proficiency with ATLAS.ti,
but I expect the trend line to merge with plan soon.  I am reporting
the new metric.

Sticking to the plan from last week, I have been reading NIST reports and
implementation guides on S-CAP.  I am certain now that S-CAP holds the
key to streamlining the certification and accreditation problem for cross
domain systems.  Validation of the solution, however, is going to slip
out of the schedule under the revised due date.  Dr Martin has suggested
that the way to handle it is by publishing a separate article on that
aspect of the problem immediately after completing the dissertation,
and Dr Ashbourn concurs.  I am planning to do it that way now, to make
the 20th April deadline.

I think it would be a good idea to write Chapter 6 immediately whilst
I have that information in my head.  Part of the schedule will slip but
not the final date.
