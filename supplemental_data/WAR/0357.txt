Several reasons for the emergence of implicit channels in the CT&E
activity have become clear. They are the inefficiency of the required
formal channels, the relative insufficiency of their capacity given
typical schedules (which pressure directly leads to the emergence of
implicit channels carrying forerunner communication in order to meet
the schedule), and the emergence of channel coding for security of the
sender of forerunner communication, the key for which is supplied by
the difference between 'product' and 'process' knowledge. The fragility
of implicit channels serves no positive purpose, but the fact of their
existence in spite of the drawbacks argues for their necessity.

Speaking of the difference between product and process knowledge (although
from the other direction), as a footnote, it seems necessary to reassess,
in light of the catalogue of NSA's TAO capabilities that was published
recently, the developer's perception of the government security testers'
attitude of arrogance toward non-government insiders. It provides a
second example, and a verifiable one, of the developer's limited view
and of the asymmetry of knowledge inherent in CT&E.

I was granted a new patent this week, for 'Nested Digital Signatures
with Constant File Size', US 8,793,499 B2 (assigned to the Lockheed
Martin Corporation). It has applications to reliable human review of
satellite imagery.

Status: working on Chapter 5, and some on Chapters 6 and 7.
