Weekly activity report no. 20120301.1655 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0230, seventh week HT

GSS report submitted.  I spent some time further developing the idea of
applying HAZOP to prediction of collapse risks in software engineering
projects; I have been looking for parallels in the CS-1 evidence as codes
are assigned.  I further refined the cross domain system analogy, which
now links to HAZOP, but not in the way at first planned; I do not have
time to go into much detail about the example P&ID, but it serves as a
bridge to introduce HAZOP.  Some of the guide words may have to be altered
or re-interpreted to apply, but the methodology allows for this; it feels
like it can be hammered into place.  All this is supporting argumentation,
not the core argument; it will be described as direction for future work.
I have a book on request through interlibrary loan that is needed to tie
up loose ends.  Some other ICE-developed safety principles, including
substitution (although not intensification; I can find no application),
as well as attenuation or moderation, have clear parallels in software
engineering methodology and will assist in justifying the link to HAZOP.
Regarding the main argument, I am tabulating possible root cause reasons
for the CS-2 failure, using a method from Lockheed's Advanced Technology
Group, even as I am finishing up CS-1 coding.  Status: CS-1 coding
is 80% done; role profile database not complete but I will finish it
before Monday.  Next critical task after network diagrams and categories
is dissertation outline.  I will schedule a meeting with Dr Fl√©chais
as soon as I finish coding the last of the CS-1 evidence.
