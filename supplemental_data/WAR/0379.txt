Chapter 5 is working now. It contains all of the required figures, and is
missing only some internal references and an ending. After that is done,
I need to clean up all the revision notes in other chapters and re-read for
copyediting. I sent a new draft thesis to my supervisors tonight but I'll
be working more on it in the morning. I owe a GSO.3 form to Julie Sheppard
in the department. The academic secretary in my college agreed to renew my
library card into the new term to prevent my computer accounts expiring in
the middle of submission.
