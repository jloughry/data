Weekly activity report no. 20081120.2028 (GMT) sequence no. 0059, week 6 MT

I am working on my slides and talk for the Friday afternoon seminar that happens
on 5th December.  I heard from Dr Simpson; he wants to schedule my transfer viva
in January.  I told him what my availability is.

Reading this week: R.V. Jones's history of scientific intelligence in WWII,
interviewing methods, and about Hadoop, a distributed computing framework that
implements map-reduce.
