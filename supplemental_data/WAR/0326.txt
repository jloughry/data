Weekly activity report no. 20140102.1528 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0326, week -2 HT

The first part of chapter 5 and conclusion are done. Dissatisfied with
the default edge labels in the network diagrams made with ATLAS.ti, I
have been going through some of them and updating relations to have more
meaningful labels; it makes it much easier when referring to a particular
edge in the text. One network diagram I made without anonymised names
is becoming a problem and needs re-making, but it contains important
relations, and if I do it right, they should all automatically update in
the other diagrams. Now that the holidays are over I hope to have the
rest of Chapter 5 done in a few more days. I am working down the list
of implicit communication channels that can be argued from interactions
observed in the data, on validation of hypotheses, and I added two new
context diagrams to place the developer's and certifiers' experience
with C&A processes to show where the R'' case study happened in the
progression from DCID 6/3 to DIACAP.
