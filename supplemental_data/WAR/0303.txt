Weekly activity report no. 20130725.1909 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0303 week 8+6 TT

I compared my categorisation of certifier and developer behaviour observed
during CT&E to a report I obtained from the U.S. Department of Defence
Office of General Counsel about government employee misconduct (DoD OGC,
2012). That report places emphasis on theory explaining the connection
between data collected and the reasons for misconduct (hence, to direct
effort towards solving the problem); while not exactly comparable to
my thesis, it is parallel, and aligns with what I read in Daft and
other places. I am working on explaining my theory and making sure it
explains adequately.

I referred to the exam regulations for content of theses and the procedure
for resubmission to the examiners; a detailed report of about 2000 words
indicating the specific changes made is requested; I was already going
to do that. Other occurrences this week: 'A Model of Certifier and
Accreditor Risk Calculation for Multi-Level Systems' was accepted to
the conference in Boston (12--14 November); camera ready copy is due by
11th Sept. A response to examiner action was sent on USPTO 13/355,210
in advance of publication of the application. The patent application
was published this week.
