Weekly activity report no. 20131128.1828 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0321, week 7 MT

I sent the first two chapters of my thesis to my supervisors
this week. The next chapter (on methodology) will be sent probably
tomorrow. GSS report has been submitted. I need to renew my student visa
with the student immigration office.

Reading group this week covered Deena Alghamdi's transfer report
on familial security in the Saudi and UK banking systems. There is
insufficient information to compute the statistical significance of
the reported five incidents per month in one bank branch (which looks
like 0.25 percent to 0.3 percent of customers in the branch, or sixty
incidents per year) but if 1000 customers is the typical size of a branch,
then interviews with at most 400 branch managers should be sufficient to
establish a .95 confidence level for an effect of such a small size. It
would be interesting to know if the branch manager whom Deena spoke with
can see all of the incidents in that branch, and to know the fraction of
customers visiting that branch per month, the total number of customers
handled by the branch, and the number of branches in the country. I would
also like to know the relative incidence in the UK and KSA compared with
those of eastern Europe, Asia, and South American regions.
