Weekly activity report no. 20071206.1642 sequence no. 0011 week 9 MT

Currently working on assignments for the Safety Critical Systems (SCS), and
Specification and Design (SDE) courses.  To these ends I am working with three Z
tools (alloy, fuzz, and jape), playing with some ideas for Z description of UNIX
makefiles, and reading the Perrow book.

Next week: Design for Security (DES) course all week.

Books I am reading this week: _Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk
Technologies_ by Charles Perrow; and _Ignition!: An Informal History of Liquid
Rocket Propellants_ by John D. Clark.
