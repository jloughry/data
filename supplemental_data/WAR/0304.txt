Weekly activity report no. 20130801.1825 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0304 week 8+7 TT

I was reminded by my college this week that I need to re-submit soon. I
have not received the examiners' report by post, and the college porter
says it is not in my pigeonhole, though it has been received by the
college offices. I asked the academic administrator to send me a copy
of the report. I expect I will have the revised chapters ready for my
supervisors to look at the end of next week.

To shore up the argument about informal communication networks observed
to be overlaying formal communication channels, I found references
in the literature to 'organisational façades' which perform useful
services by adapting apparent structure to the needs of the receiver
(1993). If unrecognised, however, façades can lead to false conclusions
by researchers, leading to Starbuck's (2010) exhortation to use the
methods I used because they detect and penetrate façades. To justify
the design of the present study vis-à-vis comparison of success with
failure, Pfeffer's 'Law of Unresolvable Ignorance' (1981) supplies the
needed rationale from a population ecology angle. Supporting part of my
theory that government security testers unavoidably leak information to
the developer about unpublished attack methods and therefore continually
must replenish their supply of attacks by means of original research, I
found reference in the literature to the same idea but in the context of
'Knowledge-Intensive Firms' (KIFs) from 1992. I am deeply in re-writing
the revised argument and evidence and am working head-down all week. I
will report progress again at the end of the week.
