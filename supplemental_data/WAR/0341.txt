I had software engineering interviews all day at Google. The facility is
amazing inside; their software development environment moreso. Late in
the day it began to steer from software engineering toward secure software
engineering; there is at least one person in Boulder thinking about what
an insider with unmonitored access could get up to. I should receive
feedback in about a week, if more interviews are to be scheduled. It
was a very intense day. I have no idea at all how well I scored.

I have Dr Fl√©chais's review notes on Chapter 5 and I am starting to
work on that again now; he wants it back ASAP. I have no more distraction
from possible job interviews for at least a week. Going back to work on
my thesis.
