Weekly activity report no. 20081017.0034 sequence no. 0054, week 1 MT

I present my work on Friday at the DPhil student conference, held at Keble.
It's basically the same as the first chapter of my transfer report, so the work
carries over from one to the other.

I showed my incomplete draft transfer report to Reading Group a couple of days
ago.  They all raved over the style of writing, said it was both interesting and
enjoyable to read.  They encouraged me strongly to quit trying to write in
formal academic style and just write more in the same way I wrote that first
chapter.  So I'm inspired by that.  I have been having a lot of trouble writing
this transfer report (as you well know), mainly because I have been trying to
write it `perfectly'.  I finally broke down and just wrote the first chapter all
over again in my own voice.  And what do you know---it worked.  So I'm going to
write the whole transfer report in that style, just as soon as this presentation
is done tomorrow.

Next meeting with Dr Martin will be next week when he gets back from travel.  I
should have the whole thing done by then.

Other activities: none.
