I thought I was done removing unneeded files from the evidence directory
but I was wrong; some PDF files needed to be put back and a further
search uncovered other unnecessary files that are not included in the data
analysis. I am still engaged in going through the whole thesis from the
beginning, editing for clarity. I spent a few hours this week on student
loan paperwork and helped OUSS with the Michaelmas term card. I have
started working on presentation slides for the conference in November;
presentations are due to the editor before 8th November.
