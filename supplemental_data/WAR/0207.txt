Weekly activity report no. 20110922.1544 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0207, week -2 MT

Between times reading the dissertations recommended to me by Dr Fléchais
on grounded theory model building, I have been planning how to finish
CS1 and get on to CS2 and CS3 soon.  Next week 28--30th September I
will be in New York at the USAF Rome Laboratory for the final report,
delivery, and installation of their probabilistic redaction system.
A number of reports are due soon for the end of the contract and I must
prepare a presentation.

Miscellaneous: call for papers was issued this week for the 2011 CS
department student conference; the committee have been working behind
the scenes on conference organisation.

Reading: Adams (2001), Faily (2011), Fléchais (2005), and following
references.
