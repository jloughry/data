Weekly activity report no. 20080413.1045 sequence no. 0028 week -1 TT

I am in Colorado this week getting research material.  I have a
meeting tomorrow with the corporation's lawyer to finalise issues about
proprietary information, Export Control, and ITAR.  I am working carefully
here to make sure that any materials I copy are completely OK in terms
of both intellectual property and scientific ethics.

I should be back in Oxford on Wednesday.
