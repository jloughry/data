Weekly activity report no. 20080124.2202 sequence no. 0018 week 3 HT

I needed to catch up on work for Lockheed Martin, so that's where I spent most
of my time this week.  I attended several departmental seminars and lectures
plus the Security reading group (on 'User Centered Security' by Zurko).  I will
get back to reading next week.
