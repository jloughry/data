Weekly activity report no. 20080417.1949 sequence no. 0029 nought week HT

Back from travel to the U.S.  The purpose of this trip was to obtain source
materials needed for my DPhil research.  I was successful; I brought back a
treasure-trove of records, the entire history of the project from beginning to
end (unclassified portions only).  I also got export control and ITAR letters
saying I could take the materials out of the country.

I met informally with two of the project managers (in preparation for real
interviews later) and one of the corporation attorneys about how to proceed.  He
gave me some information about how to avoid problems with proprietary
information.  The case study will have to be anonymised.  I am working on a list
of participants I want to interview.

While there, I gave a talk at the Lockheed Martin facility in Deer Creek Canyon
about my experiences in Oxford, the Computing Laboratory, and my DPhil research.

I also put on the Security Reading Group wiki, although not on the schedule yet,
a request to present my transfer report to the group for criticism and feedback.

Next steps: (1) start inventorying and indexing all the materials I brought back
with me; (2) meet with Dr Martin soon to discuss outline of transfer report; (3)
think about theoretical component which is still needed.
