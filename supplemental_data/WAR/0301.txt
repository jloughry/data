Weekly activity report no. 20130711.1954 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0301 week 8+4 TT

I read some book chapters on reproducibility of results and data
(vanDick2010, Perrow1995, Staw1995, Daft1995) that, combined with what
was written in the examiners' draft report prompted some work on the
methodology to fully describe the data access arrangement in place and
agreements with Lockheed permitting use of the CS-1 data and export
controls on carrying it and the CS-2 data internationally. I am still
working on the improved network relation diagrams in ATLAS. Still no word
on the final examiners' report from MPLS division, but Julie Sheppard
has been keeping me informed. I am working on several chapters at the
same time and I will send them to my supervisors as soon as possible.

Reading group met this week to discuss 'A capability-based security
approach to manage access control in the Internet of Things' by Gusmeroli,
et al. (Math. & Comp. Modelling, 2013). Some interesting things we
talked about on Skype included the whole idea of event-based expiration
of authorisation tokens; and decoupling authority from reference, as in
the old spy story trope of having the key to a safe deposit box in some
city but not knowing where that box is. Anonymous capabilities can be
used to implement pseudonymity---you can have a collection of anonymous
CAPs to use as online identities, but there is a privacy problem if this
scheme is anchored in a TPM.

The IEEE conference paper I submitted in March has survived another
round of peer review and is now in the final round.
