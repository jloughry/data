Weekly activity report no. 20080724.2110 sequence no. 0042 week 8+6 TT

I am working on the first draft of the transfer report, promised to Dr Martin
during the first week of August.

Other activity: I have been working on a proposal at work, in response to an RFP
from the U.S. Air Force.  (Dr Martin is aware of what it is.)  The proposal was
submitted last night.  It is for a very academic sort of research project that I
suggested.  If we win the competition, it'll result in some published papers.  I
got some good experience in academic writing, doing the proposal.

I attended a conference in Oxford last weekend: on Global Catastrophic Risks at
the James Martin 21st Century institute.  I learned at least two useful things
at this conference (besides asteroid impacts, supernova radiation, global
warming, and influenza pandemics): how to calculate conditional probabilities,
and how to do a good presentation.  I saw some very good presentations, and a
few not-so-good ones.  I have some specific notes on what not to do.

I am dialled into the Black Hat security briefing on Dan Kaminski's newly
announced DNS vulnerability tonight, listening to it.  Network administrators
are going to be doing a lot of patching tomorrow.
