Weekly activity report no. 20131024.2047 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0316, week 2 MT

I made excellent progress this week due to instituting two new
progress and time tracking measures: firstly, keeping a log of exactly
how much time was spent on every different activity (checking and
correcting references, revising Ch. 1, revising Ch. 2, revising
Ch. 3, adding material to the appendices, sysadmin tasks, email,
reading, etc.); and secondly, commits to the revision control system
(via diffs visible in GitHub). I improved the flow of the main thesis
throughout the justification and history sections and I am getting into
the methodology. I am finally making faster progress. My conference
presentation is due to the editor in two weeks but I am not working it
at the moment, staying on task.
