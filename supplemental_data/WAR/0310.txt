I finished making changes to the IEEE HST'13 conference paper in
response to the anonymous referees' comments and sent a final PDF to the
organisers this week. I had some problems getting ATLAS.ti to embed only
Type 1 fonts in the figures I was generating with the tool, but finally
got it to work. I spent a fair amount of time this week in ATLAS.ti,
improving network diagrams and some of the relations and codes. This
was prompted by rewriting that section of the conference paper where
the referees had had questions and comments on the grounded theory. The
theory description is much improved now, I think, and all of it is going
straight back into the thesis. With that paper done, I am back to work
now on post-viva corrections.

I have a job interview early next week with a company that wants to
design a new cross domain product. I can't start any new job until
after submission, so the pressure is on. I need to work on the first
three chapters tomorrow and finish them to give to my supervisors, then
arrange some time with Dr Fl√©chais to go through the grounded theory
complete description looking for holes.

Michaelmas term (the earliest I can re-submit) begins in four weeks.
