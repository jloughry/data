Weekly activity report no. 20120322.2041 (GMT-6) sequence no. 0233, week 8+2 HT

I read a report by G.E.P. Box from 1979 on use of statistical methods
to improve robustness of scientific models, and three books by Kletz on
dividing up process control systems for the purpose of predicting hazards.
I have been notified this week that DTIC.mil is publishing the final
technical report on Probabilistic Redaction.  I would like to submit a
paper to the AReS 2012 conference (deadline 28th March), but I am very
short of time to work on it.
