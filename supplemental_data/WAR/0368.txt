Weekly activity report no. 20141023.2006 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0368, week 2 MT

I attended training on the latest assessment & authorisation process
update and the Unified Cross Domain Solutions Management Office (UCDSMO)
transition, including (finally!) commonality across FISMA, DoD, and IC
processes using 800-53 security controls. The reason for the difference
between SABI and TSABI requirements was explained; that alone made the
seminar worthwhile, and cleared up a puzzling inconsistency in Chapter
4. Working at the public library continues to be useful and I have made
much more progress on Chapter 5. I can be reached by email outside library
hours, but not during.

The Oxford Security Reading Group started for the term. This past week we
discussed the paper 'Deniable Liaisons' by Narain, et al. (ACM CCS'14,
to appear); tomorrow, 'Rosemary: A Robust, Secure, and High-Performance
Network Operating System' by Shin, et al., from the same conference, is on
the schedule. After reading group I shall be back in the library.
