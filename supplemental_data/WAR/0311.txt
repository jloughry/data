I made less progress on thesis corrections this week than I had intended
to, because I took time to write up a side issue (below). I got a small
amount of work done on Chapters 1 and 3, wrote some new material that
will go in Chapter 4, but am way behind schedule and need to catch up
and deliver finished chapters to my supervisors. With the conference
paper and job interview out of the way, I can focus again.

Reading group introduced the paper 'Socio-Technical Study on the
Effect of Trust and Context When Choosing WiFi Names' by Ferreira, et
al. (LNCS 8203, 2013). The discussion progressed to conceptual attacks
against mobile devices in particular areas to defeat VPN. Afterwards I
had a brief meeting with Dr Martin. We talked about the next day's job
interview and an idea I came up with for improving the attack resistance
of cross domain systems, based on my observation of professional security
testers' behaviour during certification and accreditation. Before I met
with this company, I wrote-up the design principles to protect them;
provisional patent application 61/879,059 has been filed on it.

I had a telephone interview with Tresys Technology for a job;
they are looking for someone with lots of cross domain experience,
low-level software development in C, certification & accreditation,
proposal experience, familiarity with open source, and willing to
work remotely. The only qualification on their list that I do not have
is experience directing other people. I gave them my availability as
approximately this October. I stressed that have to finish my thesis
beforehand.

Michaelmas term begins in three weeks.
