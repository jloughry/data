Weekly activity report no. 20080918.2123 sequence no. 0050 week 8+14 TT

I met today with my supervisor and showed progress on the Transfer Report.  I am
working on that exclusively for the next two weeks.  I will have a complete
draft to Dr Martin before the last day of September.  That puts me right on
track for submission of the transfer report and forms by week 1 of Michaelmas
term.  Right on schedule.

Dr Martin gave me some specific feedback on methodology, references, viva, and
literature survey that I will incorporate.

Status: motoring along and having a good time doing it.
