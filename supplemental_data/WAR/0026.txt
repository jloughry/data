Weekly activity report no. 20080327.2102 sequence no. 0026 week -3 TT

My research trip to the USA is now definitely scheduled for April 8--15.  At
that time I will secure the source materials that I obtained permission to use
earlier.

Continuing to read and collect references for the literature survey portion of
my Transfer Report.

Meetings are taking a break this week for Easter.  I will introduce a paper at
the next Security Reading Group on April 2nd.

Not much else to report because I spent several full days this week doing my
U.S. tax forms.
