I have been reviewing previous research on PM replacements for any mention
of its effect on existing projects, particularly with respect to the
'arrival effects' of Parker, et al., which I think are the primary source
of effect on implicit/informal channels in the CT&E phase of C&A. I am
trying to do two or three finished pages a day on these themes. I show
what has been written about each theme before, what was observed in my
case study (quantitatively when possible), discuss briefly whether it
agrees qualitatively with those other researchers, and how it ties into
the new grounded theory. I have support for the idea now that informal
channels are disrupted more than formal channels by PM changes, explaining
the larger than expected effect in my observations. I am proceeding to
treat the other themes similarly. Forerunner communication is the most
important information transferred over implicit channels. I am trying
to decide if there is any real difference between implicit and informal
channels.

Reading group meets Monday to discuss a paper about a proposed instruction
set extension for CPUs that does not require secure on-chip non-volatile
memory.
