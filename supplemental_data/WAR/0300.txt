Searching out more places in the data where certifiers can be observed
to be teaching the developers on a point of practice (there are no
corresponding information flows in the other direction), I found more
examples of forerunner communications. I have been working on improving
the anonymisation of personal names and sub-groups within the developer,
certifiers, and contractors and to a much-needed alignment of names
between CS-1 and -2 where they share participants. I need a few more days
to work on this. Julie Sheppard replied to my query about the examiners'
report to say it is being processed by MPLS division and should not be
much longer. I have not sent the new chapters to my supervisors yet but
will before the 10th.
