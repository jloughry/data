Weekly activity report no. 20090611.2010 (GMT+1) sequence no. 0088, week 7 TT

I am buckling down for the work required over the next 12 months.  That is 4
peer-reviewed published papers before confirmation of status in June 2010.  I am
going by a useful piece of advice from Dr Martin: `your thesis is three good
ideas that you have had published'.  Each paper will be a chapter.  The first
paper I am going to write (starting now) is a version of the same talk I have
given at two seminars.  Goal is to get the paper written and submitted to the
journal _Crosstalk: The Journal of Defence Software Engineering_ before I have
to move house at the end of July.

Status of parallel tasks:

1. Waiting for a reply from Dr Ian Levy of CESG regarding interview (Legal);
2. Clone \LaTeX\ files and tailor Makefile and CVS for each of the 4 papers;
3. FINISH METHODOLOGY CHAPTER OUTLINE!
4. Update wiki with Bletchley Park maps, trip information, and schedule;
5. I am introducing the next Reading Group paper on Wednesday.

Books I have been reading this week:

Knuth (1986) _The \TeX book_
Still working on Bock's book (1999) on methodology;

TO DO:

1. Trinity graduate student supervision report (tonight);
2. First paper draft (tomorrow);
3. Detailed plan for next 12 months (needed for following task);
