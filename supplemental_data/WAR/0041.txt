Weekly activity report no. 20080717.2247 sequence no. 0041 week 8+5 TT

As discussed last week, I have been working on a Lockheed Martin proposal all
week.  It's a very research-oriented proposal, though, so the writing style is
academic---I've been getting a lot of practice writing!

Back to work on thesis tomorrow.

Other activities: I saw "King Lear" performed at the Globe Theatre in London
last night with St Cross College.  It was grand.  Like nothing I have ever seen
before.

It was a bloody play; during intermission they mopped the stage.  Seriously.

The best part was the stagehand in renaissance costume who popped up through a
trapdoor with Makita in hand, and quickly drove in a few screws to fix a loose
board on the stage.
