Weekly activity report no. 20080911.2113 sequence no. 0049 week 8+13 TT

I am writing my transfer report.  Lockheed Martin laid me off for a few weeks
due to budget problems.  The new fiscal year starts 1st October---they should be
back to normal then, but I am taking advantage of the time to work on my
transfer report!

Other activities: I wrote and submitted through EasyChair two reviews for the
Comlab Student Conference in October.  I submitted an abstract myself; waiting
to hear whether it will be accepted.

I visited Bletchley Park and met Tony Sale in person, standing in front of the
Colossus Mark II rebuild.  He tore off a piece of paper tape and gave it to me.
