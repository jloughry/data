Weekly activity report no. 20071227.1759 sequence no. 0014 week 12 MT

Nothing particular to report; everyone in my family is ill this week, having
come down with a bad cold right after Christmas.  Continuing to work on reading;
two assignments still due.

Meeting scheduled with Dr. Martin on Friday, 4th January 2008 at 0930 to plan
for Hilary Term.

I hope everyone had a good Christmas (we did, thanks to Skype) and a Happy New Year.
