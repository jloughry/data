Weekly activity report no. 20080403.2128 sequence no. 0027 week -2 TT

I have an opportunity to give a talk about experiences at Oxford at my company
next week.  It should be good practice, standing up in front of 80 people.  I am
preparing slides using the LaTeX beamer class.

One of the purposes of this trip is to secure paper records of source material
that I need for my transfer report.  Because the records are stored in a secured
area, I can't rightly ask someone else to box up a bunch of records (not really
knowing what they are), and mail it to another country.  Better I do it myself.
 The cost of the trip will be worth it to have the records.

I will be in the USA all next week.  Next regular meeting with Dr Martin will be
during Week 1.
