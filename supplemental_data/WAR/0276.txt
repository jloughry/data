Weekly activity report no. 20130117.2217 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0276 week 1 HT

Necessary progress was made this week against the following targets:
improved contents of Chapters 3, 4, 5, and Appendices A and B.  I got
the indexing macro working, although I am waiting to finish inserting
commands for the index until the last build.  I will have the three
chapters mentioned above all finished by Sunday, and then followed by
Chapters 6 and 7 to wrap up by the 22nd.
