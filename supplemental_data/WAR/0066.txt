Weekly activity report no. 20090108.1850 (GMT) sequence no. 0066, week -1 HT

I am reviewing for my transfer viva on 16th January.  I met with Dr Martin on
7th January during which we discussed viva procedures, preparation, strategy,
and plans for the upcoming term.

I am working on a short introductory talk for the beginning of the viva.  We
also discussed the New Security Paradigms Workshop 2009, being held in Oxford
this year, with regard to my submitting a paper to the workshop.

I am planning to write a letter to the president of Green Hills Software, Inc.
regarding their recent successful evaluation of INTEGRITY-178B at EAL6+.

I have registered to attend an event in London next month about requirements
changes for existing systems.  It looks like something that might be relevant to
my research.  I heard about it from Marina Jirotka.

I have Dr Martin's copy of PRG-126.
