I made much better progress on my thesis this week by relocating to work
in the basement of the public library, away from my house. Without so
many distractions, I got far more work accomplished on Chapter 5, so
I am continuing to use the library that way. Job interviews on Friday
were highly encouraging, but the federal government hiring process is
unbelievably complicated; as of now only some of the large collection
of required documents have been submitted. (The process is, at least,
common across agencies so it only needs be done once.) The pay is low
but the scientific content would be high with this agency. I am following
other leads as well, as I have student loans to pay back. Status: I need
a few more days in the basement of the public library to hack on Chapter
5 and then it will be done.
