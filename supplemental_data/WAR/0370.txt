I had to go back to the raw data looking for quotations that indicate
developers and certifiers' tolerance for residual risk and/or suggesting
the lengths they are likely to go to in order to address threats or
vulnerabilities. Examples of several different types have been found,
although there are not really enough instances of each to call them
classes. I do compare most to a previous example in the literature. I am
working in the library every day. If not pulled away from this, I expect
to have it done by 19th November. Reading Group meets tomorrow to discuss
a paper from Newcastle describing a method for uncovering gaps in protocols
and a vulnerability they discovered in VISA contactless cards (ACM CCS'14,
to appear).
