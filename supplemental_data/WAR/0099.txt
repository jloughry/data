Weekly activity report no. 20090828.0049 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0099, week 8+10 TT

I want to attend the 25th ACSAC (Annual Computer Security Applications
Conference) in December in Hawaii.  I just found out that David Kleidermacher of
Green Hills Software is giving a paper at the conference on lessons learnt from
their EAL 6+ evaluation.  I talked with Mr Kleidermacher quite a lot at the
Trust 2009 conference a few months ago; he finally wrote the paper.

The deadline for paper submissions is past, but the deadline for posters is 18th
September.  I have never done a poster presentation, but I am reading about how
to do them and I think I can make the deadline.  I can pay my own way to the
conference but I will see if I can get my employer, my college, or the
department to help with the cost.  The timing is extremely tight if I want to
get my submission reviewed by government security, but I want to try.  I will
discuss this with Dr Martin in our regular weekly meeting tomorrow.

I have spent far too much time on Lockheed work in the past 10 days; I must get
back on schedule ASAP.

To-Do List (abbreviated):

1. Poster submission

2. Pre-pub review

3. Crosstalk article draft, review, and submission

4. Methodology chapter

5. Reading, write survey questions, conduct interviews, prototyping.
