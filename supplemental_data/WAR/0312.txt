Weekly activity report no. 20130926.1738 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0312 week -2 MT

This week I have been improving the introduction and motivation
in Chapter 1, fixing the macros that insert index entries throughout,
pruning uncoded PDF files (something I forgot to do) from the evidence
directory in preparation for including it, and thinking about the argument
in Chapter 6; specifically, if certain stipulations---such as the minimum
number of accreditors, or security clearance/classification dominance
in the accreditor model, or the delay between testing and reporting and
developers' responses in the certifier model, or the presence/lack of
precursor communication during CT&E---are negated or changed, does the
argument still hold? Only some of these tests are checkable by reference
to the data, but I have to pre-emptively counter all of the objections
before any reader is able to raise them. I have notes for improving
the description of the methodology in Chapter 3, something the Examiners
specifically called out, but have not entered those notes yet. I am trying
to ensure throughout early chapters that the thesis is introduced right
up front and successively reinforced by wave after wave of detail, i.e.,
that I have established that a problem exists, that data are sufficient
to solve it, that the particular methodology is necessary to handle
the data, that the analysis was deep enough, that the interpretation is
complete and sound, and that results are useful in the real world. I feel,
however, that I am not making progress fast enough. No word from Tresys
Technology in regard to my interview last week; I followed up with the
company afterwards to indicate interest, but I expect them not to decide
anything until Congress acts on the government's budget next week.

Michaelmas term begins in two weeks.
