I am continuing to work on my thesis, on paper at this time. There are
22 updates presently in the queue to be applied to the working version
in GitHub. No other significant events to report this week. Travel
arrangements for Boston will need to be made soon, and the final paper for
that conference is due in two weeks. Michaelmas term begins in six weeks.
