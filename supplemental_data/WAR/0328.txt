I got tipped to a job posting at Lockheed, a year-long contract beginning
soon; they need two people with network security experience to travel to
Europe in March. I have built up similar black box systems in the past;
I called the manager but he said it has to be posted internally. If they
decide, however, to let a short-term contract to get the project done,
he has my contact info.

I sent a proposal to the technical committee meeting at IBM in San Jose
for the first week in February. I wrote the paper with two co-authors:
Terence Eden and Bruce Nordman (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). I
should know by next week if the proposal is on the agenda for the first
quarter's Technical Committee meeting; we have received a document number,
L2/14-009. I heard back from the reviewer today that I do not need to
travel to California for the meeting, fortunately. We wrote the proposal
in a rush since the call for agenda items on Saturday but it received good
reviews from the technical reviewers. I am hopeful of getting funding,
but it will not be for a while.

Back to working on Chapter 5, tonight I have been making progress on
a new section about validating hypotheses leading to grounded theory;
more work is needed on cleaning up network diagrams so they are readable
when printed in the page size, and explaining relationships in the CT&E
phase understandably. I am dropping the ST&E phase because all of it
took place at SPAWARSYSCENLANT and I was not there; all I have is what
people who travelled there said about it. Because of the proposal, I am
four days behind, but I will catch up in the morning. I still plan to
have all chapters finished before the end of the month.
