Weekly activity report no. 20131205.2141 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0322, week 8 MT

I sent another complete chapter to my supervisors, although it was Chapter
4 (case study I) rather than Chapter 3 (methodology). I am still working
on the methodology chapter since last week; however, I made good progress
on this week. It is still not good enough, though, at explaining the
methodology of case study II. I will work on it more in the morning,
and get it sent before my next report.

Other activity: I received advice from the international student office
about renewing my student visa; I am putting together the paperwork to be
submitted before I can travel again. I have no travel currently planned. I
am keeping to the schedule of giving my supervisors a chapter a week.
