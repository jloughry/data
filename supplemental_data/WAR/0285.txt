Weekly activity report no. 20130321.1628 (GMT-6) sequence no. 0285 week 8+2 HT

Applying to more jobs, no leads yet.  I applied to three new postings
at Booz Allen and two at Boeing today.  I am working on the IEEE paper.
If it is not accepted in April, I plan to submit it to ACM CCS 2013 (4--8
November, Berlin) next; the deadline for that conference is 8th May.
I am meeting with some people I know from Lockheed this evening.  I have
been working out a problem with CMAP translations in PDF files that I
think is causing copy & pasted résumé keywords to break in web forms;
the problem showed up on Lockheed's web site.  Reading group was postponed
the other day but I am introducing a paper next week.  I would like to
get input from the other members of reading group also on an up-to-date
ranking of conferences and journals in this field; in order to gather
the necessary data with minimal impact on participants, I looked for
an efficient method of ranking collections of more than seven items.
There is some interesting research published about the cognitive
burden of rating vs ranking questions in surveys (Alwin, 1985) but no
implementations; I looked at building a new one using jQueryUI sortables.
I read Gurevich's paper on 'Impugning Randomness, Convincingly' since
I couldn't make it to his seminar in the department this week.
