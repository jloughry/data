Weekly activity report no. 20141211.1905 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0375, week 8+1 MT

My submission date is 16th January, only five weeks away; my supervisors
have asked for a complete draft ASAP. I owe a GSO.3 form to Julie Sheppard
soon.

Reading Group last week looked at a new paper from CCS'14, only a few weeks
old, titled 'A Critical Evaluation of Website Fingerprinting Attacks',
by Marc Juarez, et al. The authors looked carefully at the assumptions
underlying a questionable technology (monitoring access to web sites
done via Tor relays). This week we are to look at a classic paper: 'New
Directions in Cryptography' [IEEE Trans. Info. Theory 22(6), 1976] with
background from 'Keeping Secrets' by H. Corrigan-Gibbs (2014) about the
influence of former NSA director Vice Admiral Inman on DES and D--H through
the late 1970s.
