Weekly activity report no. 20081031.1329 (MDT) sequence no. 0056, week 3 MT

I am on travel in the USA this week, catching up with some work that I can't do
remotely and obtaining more research access that I need from the corporation.  I
met with Corporate Counsel and got an agreement that they will give me a signed
letter from the corporation---something I can show to prospective interview
subjects---saying that it's okay for them to talk with me about the events in
2006--2007.  This is a major breakthrough because several people didn't want to
talk to me without that letter.  I should have the letter in hand soon.

I finished writing my transfer report on Monday at 0300.  I'm proofreading it
now, and it'll be in shape to hand in soon.  That was the hardest thing I've
ever written.  Transfer of Status forms are gathering the necessary signatures
now.  As soon as Dr Martin and I come to agreement on the final transfer report,
it'll all be over but the Assessors.  I'm practising my judo moves and weapons
proficiency for the fight.

Back in the U.K. on Monday.

Happy Halloween,
