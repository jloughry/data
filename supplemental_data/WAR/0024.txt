Weekly activity report no. 20080313.2041 sequence no. 0024 week -5 TT

Continuing to work on developing a good thesis problem.  I have been collecting
references for the literature survey.  The regular reading group meetings
continue to be a good source of leads, in addition to general discussion about
how to do research.

I have a meeting scheduled with Dr Martin tomorrow at 1100 to discuss
development of a thesis problem, and the Transfer Report.
