Weekly activity report no. 20110526.1446 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0190, week 4 TT

I mailed the first page of the new introduction to Dr Martin.  If he
approves the approach, I will complete the first draft of chapters 1--4 in
the same style.  In the middle of writing, I had to go back to Backhouse
& Dhillon (1996), DoD 8510.01, and Whyte's book (1956).  I obtained a
newly published report from the U.S. Navy this week on implications of
aggregated information systems for DIACAP C&A.  The report renders moot
a couple of assertions I made about the aim and scope of SABI approvals
with respect to national security systems.  Now I have to work around it.

Meeting with Dr Martin tomorrow.  Other than writing and re-writing
over and over with little to show besides a collection of unconnected
sentences, small progress to report this week.
