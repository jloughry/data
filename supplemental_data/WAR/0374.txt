Weekly activity report no. 20141204.1805 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0374, week 8 MT

I am still writing Ch5; the results and conclusion are well in hand, I am
struggling with getting there. I figured out that I was using the wrong
approach in the part before the time line and have corrected course now. I
am proceeding straight through the middle now to get it done. I should have
a complete draft of the middle in a few more days. I have been thinking
about how this research applies to incident response and continuous
monitoring; although the time scale is shorter, the required communication
between executives and the incident officer, through an incident manager to
incident responders, resembles the structure of a C&A activity to a degree
and analogous information flows may be expected there.

Reading group discussed the paper 'Large Scale Test of Sensor Fingerprint
Camera Identification' by Goljan, et al. (SPIE Electronic Imaging, 2009),
suggested by Chad. Our analysis ranged across what was not in the paper:
why the number of data points was the size that it was; to considering
the detector as an EW problem---i.e., could a synthetic fingerprint be
crafted to trap the detector into keying on it preferentially; geometric
transformations that the researchers did and did not consider; Chad noted
that these are very robust signals. Reading group tomorrow will discuss
a new paper testing the effectiveness of Tor fingerprinting attacks from
CCS'14.
