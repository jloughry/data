Weekly activity report no. 20120223.1944 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0229, sixth week HT

I found a cache of old files relating to CS-1 and thoughts on the
comparison with CS-2 and CS-3; I am processing those as analytical notes.
This week I referred to an old book by Kletz (1993) on why organisations
have no memory; his perspective is from the chemical industry but it
occurred that application of HAZOP to project management, informed by
these case studies, could be a step on the way to problem avoidance.
I further developed the high-to-low analogy I plan to use for introducing
cross domain system concepts in the introduction.  Status: 75% of the
way coding CS-1 evidence, including the new file of old notes this week;
role profile database is still only 50% complete.  Next critical task
after network diagrams and categories is to flesh out lower levels on
the dissertation outline with new insights.  I plan to meet with Dr
Fl√©chais as soon as I finish coding the last of the CS-1 artefacts,
expected to require a few more days.
