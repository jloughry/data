I have been reading some articles by Coase (1937, 1960) on the structures
that lead to decision-forcing imbalances.  This is related to testing my
earlier assertion that accreditors will exchange information in violation
of the global security policy if and only if they are forced to say
something because the alternative is perceptibly worse.  It behaves like
addition of vectors but I am not convinced it holds up in every case where
a new accreditor joins who has a much higher clearance.  I am working
on a way of showing the mechanism in one figure.  For the IEEE paper,
and in case the examiners ask, I am trying to show once again that the
relation holds over all configurations of two or more accreditors in
SCI-like accreditations.  I should have it working in a few more days.

Julie Sheppard contacted me to arrange the date for my viva; once the
date is confirmed I'll make travel reservations.  I have been in contact
with a manager at Booz Allen Hamilton in Colorado and someone I know
at Accenture.  He wants me to finish the viva first and then meet.
