Weekly activity report no. 20130509.1912 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0292 week 3 TT

I have been coding previously marked-up evidence into the ATLAS.ti tool
to take advantage of its automatic counting and reference checking.
Status: currently almost through the certifier meetings at end of CT&E
phase.  When done, I need to go over the entire data set again with
the full list of codes to pick up missing entries in earlier entries.
I have been reporting progress every couple of days.  I have not observed
convergence of the coding process yet.  I am using the autocoding feature
a lot with regexes.  Travel reservations have been made for collaboration
meetings in Oxford the week of 20--24 May.  Model building in ATLAS.ti
should be complete at the end of that week of travel.  Reading group
meets next week; I have the paper for Tuesday and will participate if
the re-coding task is close enough to finished.
