Weekly activity report no. 20080120.1610 sequence no. 0016 week 1 HT

This didn't get sent out on Thursday night because I have been so busy all week
that I forgot.

All assignments for last term completed and submitted on time.  After meeting
with Dr Martin to talk about plans for the term, and in addition some late night
emails after I had some ideas about a possible thesis topic, I am going to spend
this term developing proficiency in Z notation and SPARK.

Other activities: chasing down student loan paperwork, and converting my laptop
to run FreeBSD 7-STABLE.
