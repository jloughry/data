Weekly activity report no. 20120126.2025 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0225, second week HT

I am working on a draft of the entire dissertation from beginning to
end.  I need to see where everything is and where all the pieces fit.
Activity this week should have been entirely devoted to coding in
ATLAS.ti, but I got distracted.  I will catch up for the lost time.

Reading Group this week was to go over the paper by Stefan Viehböck,
titled `Brute forcing Wi-Fi Protected Setup', but due to wide interest
and many people being out of town it was postponed.  Dr Martin and I were
both on the line, however, so we had an unscheduled meeting.  There are
unanswered questions in Viehböcks's paper; I bought a copy of the Wi-Fi
Simple Configuration Technical Specification Version 2.0.0.  I can verify
details of the WPS protocol for members of reading group next week.

Google+ Hangout is a superior video conferencing tool, more reliable
than Skype.

I will meet with Dr Fléchais tomorrow morning.
