Weekly activity report no. 20121115.2003 (GMT-8) sequence no. 0267 week 6 MT

On travel; I am in Seattle this week, leaving for Rennes in two days.
I am practising my talk for the C&ESAR 2012 conference next week and
working on the slides.  GSS report has been submitted.  I owe a set
of figures to Dr Fl√©chais showing how the complete grounded theory
references backwards to where, when, by whom, in what groups, and in
what context that repeated or significant phrases, concepts, or actions
were observed.  I'll be able to finish after I have given my talk.

Working off-line today and tomorrow because this site has extremely poor
network availability.
