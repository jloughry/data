I am still cutting down Chapter 5, getting close to being finished with
the chapter (it is due Monday). The deadline for the completed thesis to
be delivered to my supervisors is 21st July (also a Monday). Remaining
tasks for next two weeks: expand interpretations in Chapter 6 to cover
the new material, update conclusions in Chapter 7 if necessary, and
assemble the appendices, which are already in PDF format and just need
to be included.
