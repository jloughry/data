Weekly activity report no. 20130221.1931 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0281 week 6 HT

Upon consulting with Julie Sheppard, I applied for a 'student visitor
(less than six months)' UK visa to cover the likely interval of viva
with time for revisions.  GSS report for the term has been submitted.
I have been helping the OU Scientific Society set up next week's
debate at the Sheldonian.  I attended an ISACA meeting in Denver this
week to meet people and hear the scheduled speaker, on 'Moving Towards
Continuous Risk Assessment'.  The language used by auditors when talking
about fraud detection is strikingly similar to the lone accreditor
of a high-to-low (downgrader/sanitiser) cross domain system where the
low-side is unclassified (an unusual configuration, admittedly, but they
do sometimes exist).  The problem of determining the residual risk of
that system reduces in that case to the problem of the malicious insider
(which in the case of the IT auditor can be executives of the company)
combined with external threats.  I am thinking that the similarities
go deeper than terminology and some of the same approaches may work
across application areas.  As in the paper I am currently working on,
lessons learnt that are explicitly recorded in the form of policy and
procedures 'are actually the hidden tales of past disaster' [cite].
Another batch of job applications will be going out next week.
