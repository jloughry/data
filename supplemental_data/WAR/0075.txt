Weekly activity report no. 20090312.1838 (GMT) sequence no. 0075, week 8 HT

I gave a talk last Friday to an audience of 76 security engineers who are
considering grad school in mid-career.  It generated a lot of email feedback and
questions about the programme in Oxford.

Last night I was elected IT Officer of the Oxford University Scientific Society
(OUSS).  Duties are said to be minimal, but they needed someone to help them
with Google Calendar.  In return I get to have dinner with Nobel Prize winners.

I am trying hard to stick to a regular schedule of reading chapters in the two
books I am working through currently.  I have a meeting scheduled with Dr Martin
tomorrow morning when I want to talk about progress and setting some deadlines
for me to work towards.

The week after next I have a short business trip to Washington, D.C. and New York.

Upcoming deadlines and events:

14th March: Hilary term ends
23rd March: meeting at USAF Research Laboratory in Rome, New York
23rd March: review deadline for Dr Jirotka's paper
6th--7th April: TRUST 2009 in Oxford
17th April: submission deadline for 2009 NSPW
25th April: ISSEP exam in London
