Weekly activity report no. 20110818.1645 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0202, week 8+8 TT

The assessors agreed to a date of 29th August for submission and either
7th September or more probably Thursday 8th for a viva.  Julie Sheppard
is on board with those dates.  Busy writing now, working on all parts
of the dissertation but concentrating on chapters that the assessors
need to look at.

The R'' programme manager clarified for me on Tuesday some of the last
few years' direct/overhead funding struggles between the R developer and
the Navy programme office.  This ties in with Rost and Glass's (2011)
examination of subversive stakeholders.

The Department of Computer Science 2011 Student Conference web site and
conference submission process have been set up.  The conference will
take place Friday, 18th November 2011 in lecture theatre A.

There are 21 weeks to submission.  I will buy plane tickets for Oxford
tonight.
