Weekly activity report no. 20140925.1930 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0364, week -2 MT

It took much longer than I expected this week to disengage from certain
parts of Chapter 5 where I have been concentrating, in order to get
the rest of it done and delivered to my supervisors. I missed the most
recent date that I gave Dr Fl√©chais this week because I got stuck. I
got myself unstuck and am making progress again as of last night. I
went back through my notes for anything I missed that ought to be in the
chapter, and found a few things that had been overlooked. I rearranged
the order of sections to lead the reader this time by the nose from data
to observation to argument to conclusion.

I need a few productive days of not being sick and not getting distracted
to write the remaining parts.
