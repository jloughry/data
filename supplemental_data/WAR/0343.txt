An old theme repeatedly implicated in project failures is the turnover of
project managers on software projects [Brooks, 1986; Rost, 2005; Harland
& Lorenz, 2005; National Audit Office, 2011]. In trying to quantify it,
I found four to five times as much in the project that failed compared
with one that didn't, consistent across both the developer and certifier
sides; interestingly, both projects exhibited complementary mirror
image behaviour on each side, prompting speculation that there might
have been an intra-project interaction, though the sample size is too
small to conclude it. It is the only theme that fails to tie into the
overall theme of informal communication being more important than formal
communication (i.e., standards) except in that discontinuities around
changes in project manager necessarily disrupt implicit communication
channels much more than formal ones, because formal channels are tied
to deliverables, which itinerant project managers track. I did not
finish the draft chapter this week as I wanted to, but expect to have
uninterrupted time to work on it now.
