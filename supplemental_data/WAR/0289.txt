Weekly activity report no. 20130418.1815 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0289 noughth week TT

Reading and preparing for viva in ten days.  I am reviewing all my
notes from the beginning.  I have a meeting tomorrow with Dr Martin
to go over what is expected in the viva.  The remainder of my travel
arrangements have been made.  For the current paper, I found a simpler
approach to explaining the accreditor model that works better; I am
dropping the gradient idea for now in favour of highlighting every
hazardous configuration where undesired information flow is forced.
I am drawing new figures to illustrate.  Reading group meets next week;
the assigned paper is on analysing malicious traffic in cellular carriers.
