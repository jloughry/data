Weekly activity report no. 20140424.1941 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0342, noughth week TT

In chapter 5, after the introductory sections, I am following
Dr Fl√©chais' emailed advice on describing and explaining the core
themes. These include implicit communication, particularly the beliefs of
the developer and security testers and how it drives informal and implicit
comms, which I claim exceed the importance of formal communications to
the prediction of a successful outcome, as well as planned communication,
informal communication (esp. forerunner communication), and observations
correlated with successful and unsuccessful outcomes in the CT&E
phase. The time line is being used now only where it illustrates the
occurrence or operation of a core theme, or contradicts it. Someone
else got the job at Google; I believe they were looking for a Java
specialist. If I can concentrate on this chapter for a few days straight,
I can have a new draft ready for review next week.
