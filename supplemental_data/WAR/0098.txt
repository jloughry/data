Weekly activity report no. 20090820.2107 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0098, week 8+9 TT

I have been invited to present a paper at next year's UCDMO Conference.  UCDMO
is the U.S. government's Unified Cross Domain Security Office.  The audience of
this conference are certifiers and principal accrediting authorities from NSA,
DIA, ONI, NGA, CIA, NRO and DISA.  The topic of the presentation will be my
research results.  The date is not set but it will be around Trinity term next
year.  The reviewers at this conference are practitioners who will be looking
for what works.

Dr Martin and I did not meet again yesterday because of travel and network
problems on my end.  The internet problem is fixed now and I will schedule the
next regular meeting for Skype teleconference, probably Wednesday or Thursday
27th August at the usual time.

I have had email conversations with several new people I met last week in San
Diego about current trends in effective (and cost effective) certification and
accreditation of information security systems in the near future (the next five
years).

I am still un-boxing and trying to find things, but slowly getting back to work.

To-Do List (abbreviated):

1. Finish writing paper no.~1 and submit for security review.  By my schedule I
am late on this;
2. Prototyping in Scheme (I have not accomplished any work on this since last week);
3. Write the methodology chapter.
