Weekly activity report no. 20080110.2130 sequence no. 0015 week 0 HT

I am still down with a case of the flu picked up right after Christmas.  My head
feels like it's stuffed full of cotton.  I met with Dr Martin today regarding
plans for Hilary Term and research directions; I plan to spend some time
thinking carefully, before deciding on the direction to go next.  There are many
possible good directions to go.

Working on the assignment for Specification & Design (SDE) which is due next
week, head stuffed up full of cotton or no.  Once that is done, I can get back
to important reading.
