Weekly activity report no. 20140327.2036 (GMT-6) sequence no. 0338, week 8+2 HT

I am still working on condensing the time line in Chapter 5 to fit in 30
or 40 pages. Status: CT&E phase (Beta I) is done up to the point of the
second funding crisis in which the government programme office started
cutting travel hours for the developer's software engineers; this was
coincidentally at the same time as the government security testers got
into a spat with the developer over pen test findings, but the focus at
the time was all on progress of regression testing in Charleston and the
significance of that report was not recognised yet by either the developer
or the certifier. ST&E (Beta II) at STRATCOM was much shorter and will go
quickly once I finish this part, but I have lots more data related to Beta
I (as well as interpretations) and want to include it all. Interleaving
of interpretation as discussion near the point of data is working well; I
am making good progress on the condensation task and should be done soon.

I have an interview Monday with Google; I have been preparing for it
with some review of data structures & algorithms and CS 101 exercises,
as recommended.
