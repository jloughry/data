I spent the week researching and writing a dual-purpose paper that
will satisfy a Lockheed requirement at the same time as comprising the
entirety of Chapter 6 of my dissertation.  I talked with Dr Fléchais
about it by email on Friday.  Under the circumstances I described to Dr
Fléchais, it seemed necessary to move the Chapter 6 task from late in
the schedule to now, which should not affect the end date.  I will have
the paper done by the first week of January, then return to schedule.
It partly solves the validation problem and is part of the argument.

I met with the patent attorney Monday to begin drafting an application
for patent on the other idea; it should be possible to get that filed
in January.

Next meeting with Dr Martin is 4th January.
