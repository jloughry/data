Weekly activity report no. 20140724.2055 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0355, week 8+5 TT

I missed the deadline this week that I set for myself when I thought I
would be completely finished; I am still writing Chapter 5 but have made
significant progress towards finishing it. (Later I will work to improve
my performance at estimation.) Status: closer to the end of Chapter 5,
working on clearly explicating reasons why scheduled reports are much less
important than fragile 'implicit channels' that are disrupted every time a
new project manager arrives, but have much greater bandwidth than formal
ones (in the Shannon sense that, in light of forerunner communication,
the formal channels are lower entropy to the recipient).
