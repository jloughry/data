Weekly activity report no. 20090730.2217 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0095, week 8+6 TT

Arrived safely in Colorado on Tuesday night (the following morning in UK time
zone).  Cleared US Customs and Immigration, got home to find that my sister and
my dad had moved all our stored boxes back into our house and set up temporary
beds, which was greatly appreciated.  A few hours later I called into Reading
Group via Skype video call.  The webcam session worked quite well for that
purpose.  Following the reading group meeting, Dr Martin and I continued with
our regular weekly meeting.  I did not have a lot of progress to report because
of moving house, but I described my immediate task for tomorrow: to craft a
combination progress report to Lockheed and proposal for the next 12 months
during which I want to continue working for them at a low level (much less than
full time) while concentrating my effort primarily on DPhil research.  I intend
to point out firstly that a similar arrangement has worked out well for them
during the past two years---I have met all my commitments and also brought in a
significant new piece of business---and secondly that I have a hard deadline
imposed by the University (specifically, the Confirmation of Status) one year
hence; and finally, they stand to gain by my improved capabilities once I have
finished my research and graduated.  Then they can have me back full time again.

I shall write that proposal tomorrow; I will share it with my Supervisor and
Advisor in Oxford.

Next meeting scheduled: Wednesday, 5th August after Reading Group.

To-Do List (abbreviated):

1. Write progress report/proposal to employer (tomorrow);
2. first paper final draft and submit to security review;
3. Methodology chapter.
