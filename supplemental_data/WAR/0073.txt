Weekly activity report no. 20090226.2211 (GMT) sequence no. 0073, week 6 HT

I met with Dr Ashbourn today at STX for Senior Mentor Graduate Consultation
interview.  I asked for some advice on avoiding procrastination and for getting
things done.  She gave me some specific suggestions that I will implement:

 - start reading two chapters (from Hansche2006a) every day (in preparation for
ISSEP exam);

 - make a list at the beginning of each day of certain things that must be done
that day; okay for items to roll-over, but make a new list each day;

 - clear out my email in-boxes: every item must be replied to, deleted, or filed
somewhere; in-boxes should be empty at the end of each day;

 - quit thinking about writing perfect code and start getting some practice with
the new language (in preparation for working on thesis).

I am starting to implement the suggestions right now.  I am hopeful that you
will see some improvement visible in these weekly reports.
