Weekly activity report no. 20140710.2155 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0353, week 8+3 TT

I am still working on Chapter 5, not done with it last week as planned,
but progress is being made. Some of the necessary associated updates
in Chapters 1, 4, 6, and 7 (necessitated by the results in Chapter 5)
are now done (though not all). I am behind schedule but trying to catch
up before the deadline in twelve days. Remaining tasks: finish Ch.5,
update the interpretations in Ch.6 to cover Ch.5l, update conclusions
in Ch.7 only where necessary, then gather the necessary appendices to
support the data used in Chapter 5.
