Weekly activity report no. 20080321.1234 sequence no. 0025 week -4 TT

I met with Dr Martin on Wednesday; we talked about the literature survey and
good books about scientific writing.  I am planning a trip back to Colorado to
collect the source material I will be using for research and start to get it
indexed.

Next regular meeting planned for late next week, after Easter.
