Weekly activity report no. 20140619.2002 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0350, week 8 TT

I continued to write in Chapter 5 this week, between replying to all the
people who contacted me directly about the public comments I wrote about
the FAA ruling. I was contacted by an engineer from Rockwell Collins who
provided details of the AFDX network and argued that it is dissimilar to
the architecture the Berkeley researchers found in the chassis of their
Lexus. We had an interesting discussion. I want safety critical system
designers to look at block diagrams the way I do: realising that failures
may be intelligently malicious in their aim besides being randomly
occurring (fuzzing is an example that crosses the boundary). Analogous
to fuzzing, Rockwell testers do thermal cycling but that is primarily
concerned with error detection, recovery, and propagation. I'm trying
to get them to consider the possibility of Maxwell's demon as well. The
fuss has died down finally and I promise not to say anything else that
will attract other people's attention until I finish this chapter and
give it to my supervisors.
