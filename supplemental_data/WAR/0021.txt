Weekly activity report no. 20080221.2017 sequence no. 0021 week 6 HT

I am working on formulating a thesis topic for the transfer report, which I hope
to submit in Michaelmas Term 2008, or possibly during the summer before.

Meeting scheduled with Dr Martin next Friday 29th February 2008 at noon.  We
will discuss progress toward a thesis topic then.

Other activities: I saw the boat races on the Isis the other day.  The St Cross
crew bumped the Univ boat and caused a pileup on the river that destroyed the
Univ boat.

I attended a lecture at the St Cross colloquia on 'Ultra-fast computer
algorithms for discovering new drug candidates'.  I asked the presenter a few
questions about their method for searching a database of 10^12 virtual molecules
for close matches based on a 12-element vector of atomic coordinates.  Their
method is 1500 times faster than the previous best search.
