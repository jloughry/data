Weekly activity report no. 20131003.1814 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0313, week -1 MT

Continuing to work on the same list of tasks as last week, I am not done
removing extraneous PDF files from the evidence directory yet but hope
to have that done Friday. I proposed an article for the next Reading
Group on the topic of performing computations in between instructions on
x86 processors by means of crafting only well-formed page table entries
and then alternating between single and double fault traps (Bangert, et
al., WOOT'13). The technique employs a disused hardware task switching
mechanism that is nevertheless still present and demonstrates that shadow
computation is possible below the instruction dispatch layer. I spent
some time this week on student loan and visa issues that are catching
up with me; I am working as hard as I can to finish my thesis during
the beginning of this term. Michaelmas term begins in about ten days.
