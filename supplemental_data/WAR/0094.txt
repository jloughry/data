Weekly activity report no. 20090724.0050 (GMT+1) sequence no. 0094, week 8+5 TT

The movers are coming later today.  I am kept busy with packing and cleaning
prior to leaving for the airport on Monday.

I met with Dr Martin today for our regular weekly meeting.  Next meeting will
occur by telephone.  It is scheduled after Reading Group on Wednesday, 29th July
2009.  I plan to be on Skype for next Wednesday's meeting of Reading Group,
assuming that I have a working network connection or telephone at that time.

Today we went over milestones and my plan for the next twelve months.  I have a
photograph of the whiteboard capturing dates and dependencies; I am in the
process of unravelling it into a status report and formal plan of actions and
milestones (PoA&M) to be presented to my employer as soon as I get back.  The
goal is to get them to leave me alone long enough to finish this.  I think I can
make a good case.  I intend to write that report on the aeroplane Tuesday.

I have extensive notes from today's meeting but I need to sleep before I can
write them up.  I will send out further amplification of today's weekly activity
report in a few days.
