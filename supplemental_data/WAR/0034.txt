Weekly activity report no. 20080522.2255 sequence no. 0034 week 5 TT

I met with Dr Martin on Monday and we went over the three-page Transfer Report
outline.  He suggested a few additions and one deletion; we also talked about a
research presentation to the department around the same time.  I am starting
work on the writing.  Dr Martin has to be in Edinburgh next week, so the next
meeting will skip a week back.

I had lunch with Dr Ashbourn at St Cross; she answered some questions I had
about the Transfer of Status process from another department's perspective.
Alexander, a grad student in the mathematics department, says that 'no one has
failed their transfer there in thirty years' but I'm not planning to give the
examiners any chance.  Currently I am feeling pretty good about it.  Still lots
of work to be done.

The family went to hear Dr Jane Goodall lecture at the Museum of Natural History
on Monday, about her forty years of field research with chimpanzees in Africa.
My daughter was thrilled to get to talk with Dr Goodall, as we ended up sitting
right behind her in the lecture hall.  This place (Oxford) continues to surprise
me with the opportunities available to someone living here.  I am having the
time of my life!

Walked down to the Isis to cheer the St Cross rowing team.  Then back to work.

I will enter my end-of-term supervision report into the automated system next week.
