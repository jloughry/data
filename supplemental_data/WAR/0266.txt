Weekly activity report no. 20121108.1457 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0266 week 5 MT

I am sick again with something else but working through it.  What I have
been doing since meeting with Dr Fl√©chais last week is writing functions
that find phrases in my data and show the connections between phrases,
when and where they occurred in data files, who said or did it and when,
and how that information flowed into each part of the grounded theory.
I am using the dot language (Koutsofios, 1991) for layout and pinning
nodes to preserve order of events.  I have a deadline this week for the
conference presentation that I have to do in France on 20th November.
I am on travel for the middle of next week and the following week but
should be able to get some work done during that time.  After this
conference presentation is turned over to C&ESAR 2012 in a couple more
days, I will focus on writing Ch3, 4, and 5.
