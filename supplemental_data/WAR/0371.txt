Weekly activity report no. 20141113.1936 (GMT-7) sequence no. 0371, week 5 MT

I am working to finish the current chapter by the middle of next week;
I told my supervisors the 19th. I have shifted from trying to understand
all the behaviour of the developer's software engineers with respect
to the certification authority's security testers to simply describing
what actually occurred, in the hope that the explanation will come
later. Tomorrow, reading group will discuss a paper on adding remote
attestation for VPN access control without the necessity of changing the
VPN implementation, from INTRUST 2010. I sent some notes on last week's
reading group paper to Andrew Paverd.
